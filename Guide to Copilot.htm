<p>Copilot web grounding refers to the process by which Copilot gathers
information from the web to enhance its responses. When you ask a
question or provide a prompt, Copilot can search the internet using Bing
and retrieve relevant information. This helps ensure that the answers
provided are accurate, up-to-date, and well-informed.</p>
<p>Copilot’s commercial data protection ensures the safety and privacy
of workplace AI-powered web chats. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>Authentication and Authorization</p>
<p>• Users access Copilot using their work or school (Entra ID) account.
• Tenant and user information is removed from chat data at the start of
a session. • Search queries triggered by Entra ID users are not linked
to specific individuals or organizations. • Microsoft doesn’t retain
prompts or responses from Entra ID users.</p>
<p>Data Encryption</p>
<p>• Chat data sent to and from Copilot is encrypted in transit (TLS
1.2+)</p>
<p>and at rest (AES-128) during the chat session.</p>
<p>• Microsoft has no ‘eyes-on’ access to this data.</p>

<p>No Training Data</p>
<p>• Because prompts and responses aren’t retained, they can’t be</p>
<p>used for training the underlying large language model.</p>
<p>Non-Targeted Advertising</p>
<p>• Advertising shown to Entra ID users isn’t based on workplace
identity or chat history.</p>
<p>These data protections extend to eligible Entra ID user chats in
Copilot across various platforms, including copilot.microsoft.com, Bing,
Edge, and Windows. Additionally, Copilot doesn’t retain chat history or
offer usage reporting when commercial data protection is enabled.
Remember, Copilot is grounded in data from the public web (Bing search
index) and doesn’t have access to organizational resources within
Microsoft 365, such as documents or emails.</p>
