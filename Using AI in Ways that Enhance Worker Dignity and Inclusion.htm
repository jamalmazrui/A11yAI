<p>01 Researcher’s note</p>
<p>People in under-represented groups are often disenfranchised and
devalued during moments of economic and societal transition. Amid the
great promise of using generative artificial intelligence (AI)1 in
workplaces—and we expect that the nature of most modern jobs will change
significantly—we’re concerned about the groups of workers who are least
likely to benefit. Our research findings suggest that women, workers of
color, and those over 55 could be disproportionately disadvantaged by
the broader use of AI and automation. But it doesn’t have to be that
way. 1 We define generative AI here as we described it to survey
participants, as techniques “used to generate new content, such as text,
images, and audio. Commonly used examples of generative AI include
ChatGPT, Bard, and Photoshop Generative Fill."</p>
<p><img src="media/index-3_1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.41667in"
alt="index-3_1.png" /></p>
<p>Researcher’s note <a href="https://charterworks.com">Charter</a>
02</p>
<p>For this playbook, we set out to understand the attitudes and
concerns</p>
<p>that workers and managers have around the adoption of AI in their</p>
<p>workplaces. Data we’ve collected about who is making use of this</p>
<p>technology, and who stands to benefit from it, are concerning:</p>
<p>+14 percentage points Over half of Black respondents express concern
about AI replacing them in their jobs in the next five years (53%), 14
percentage points higher than for white respondents (39%).</p>
<p>+10 percentage points Yet Black workers and managers express more
enthusiasm about using generative AI tools at work in the future (61%
vs. 51%).</p>
<p>They are also more likely to be using generative AI tools as part of
their day-to-day work already (45% vs. 37%).</p>
<p>-13 percentage points Women respondents (35%) are less likely than
male respondents (48%) to be using generative AI tools in their jobs
currently.</p>
<p>-20 percentage points Women are less likely than men to agree to the
statement “I am excited about the prospect of using generative AI as
part of my day-to day-work” (46% vs 66%).</p>
<p>Based on our reporting and research with individuals working in</p>
<p>manufacturing, service, and knowledge sectors, these are a few
things</p>
<p>we know for sureT</p>
<p>N Employers have license to talk about AI more, even
(especially!)</p>
<p>while they are learning about the technologies themselves. We are in
a moment of mutual learning: Employees and hourly workers</p>
<p>Researcher’s note <a href="https://charterworks.com">Charter</a>
03</p>
<p>alike tell us that they expect their employers to offer more
AI-focused training that will help them in their jobs. They also want to
be involved in planning and decision-making around AI to make these
technologies more time-saving and safe.</p>
<p>v The digital divide won’t correct itself. Employers have a
unique</p>
<p>role to play in helping ensure that workers across roles and</p>
<p>demographic groups are strengthened rather than undermined as</p>
<p>a result of AI in their workplacesZ</p>
<p>v Workers and worker voice have been treated as afterthoughts in</p>
<p>much of the current coverage of generative AI. We notice a</p>
<p>concerning lack of reporting and research on the ways that</p>
<p>workers themselves want to use AI in their roles.</p>
<p>This project is one attempt to address these trends. At Charter, our
interest is in distributing research-backed guidance that benefits
workers, leaders, and organizations. We see this topic—making new
technologies work for more workers—as central to our goal of making
workplaces more fair and dynamic.</p>
<p>Our intention is to offer a set of frameworks and considerations that
are broadly relevant across industries. You won’t find recommendations
about which specific AI tools to use, or specific types of jobs that
people should approach in alternate ways. Those recommendations are
evolving and others bring expertise there, including those featured in
the reading list. This particular research highlights workers’ and
managers’ perspectives and approaches for employers to adopt to proceed
from here.</p>
<p>We wrote this playbook for:S</p>
<p>v Workers: We hope that this reflects the needs, concerns, and</p>
<p>hopes for workplace AI that they shared with us, and offers</p>
<p>practical guidance to ensure that more workers see meaningful</p>
<p>benefits from AIZ</p>
<p>v HR practitioners: This playbook offers strategic frameworks for</p>
<p>centering workers and managers in AI planning and people</p>
<p>developmentZ</p>
<p>v All leaders: This is designed to help prioritize beneficial
worker</p>
<p>outcomes and see around corners regarding investments in AI</p>
<p>tools and training.</p>

11,500 film and television writers w</a>ent on strike. One of</p>
<p>their main areas of concern: generative artificial intelligence.
Years ago,</p>
<p>the idea that AI would be a threat to screenwriters would have
seemed</p>
<p>far-fetched. There w<a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/24/upshot/artificial-intelligence-jobs.html">as
a long-held assumption among a</a>cademic</p>
<p>researchers that creative work was safe from automation. The
rapid</p>
<p>rise of ChatGPT and other generative AI applications has flipped
that</p>
<p>assumption on its head.</p>
<p><a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2303.10130">A recent study
b</a>y researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania found that about 80% of the US
workforce</p>
<p>could see at least 10% of their tasks affected by large language
models.</p>
<p>Nearly one in five could see at least half of their tasks affected.
How</p>
<p>this plays out in the labor market, overall, depends on how
leaders</p>
<p>react. “The critical point is that it depends on what firms do,”
Harvard</p>
<p>Business School professor Raffaella Sadun rec<a

told the H</a>arvard</p>
<p>Business Review. “There is nothing that is predetermined at this
point.”</p>
<p>AI could be the most important technology in our lifetimes,</p>
<p>comparable to the internet or even electricity. Like other</p>
<p>transformative technologies, it can be used in ways that help or
hurt</p>
<p>workers. There are many possible futures for the technologyC</p>

<p>The decisions business leaders make around the technology and its

on workers. Over the following pages, you’ll find frameworks for
adopting AI in ways that put workers at the center.</p>
<p>Introduction <a href="https://charterworks.com">Charter</a> 08</p>
<p>Summary: How to foster human-centered</p>
<p>AI adoption in your workplace</p>
<p>Here are ways that your organization can ensure that more workers</p>
<p>benefit from AI gains, based on research and reporting for this</p>
<p>playbook<a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14sclYi7lmLveCKfDl1juY0GAMsr52l1LI_P06_K8zBQ/edit#bookmark=kix.fkzojki8fyp1">.

<p>s Recognize that discourse around AI can be exclusionary, and</p>
<p>set a more inclusive tone.^</p>
<p>s Involve workers as stakeholders in the design, selection, and</p>
<p>implementation of AI technology.^</p>
<p>s Learn how your organization’s workers and managers want to</p>
<p>be developed.^</p>
<p>s Frame AI usage in terms of raising the quality of work and</p>
<p>workers’ autonomy, instead of efficiency and cost-cuttingd</p>
<p>s Focus on lower-skilled people who could see greater gainsd</p>
<p>s Prioritize inclusive AI engagement by involving people in</p>
<p>groups that are least likely to be using AI todayd</p>
<p>s Communicate to employees how AI could change their rolesJ</p>
<p>s …without making sweeping decisions and predictions.</p>
<p>How we collected these findings</p>
<p>We’re concerned that companies will reflexively adopt AI as a
cost-</p>
<p>cutting tool rather than an opportunity to grow their businesses
while</p>
<p>improving the quality of jobs, and that AI will undermine
diversity,</p>
<p>equity, and inclusion unless there are targeted efforts to
counteract</p>
<p>that. This project is meant to shine light on alternative paths that
can</p>
<p>produce better societal outcomes.</p>
<p>We believe that understanding workers’ and managers’ lived</p>
<p>experiences and perspectives is critical for pursuing this goal. They

<p>Our research and related studies find gaps in early AI</p>
<p>adoption patterns, suggesting that members of several</p>
<p>groups risk not benefiting from gains related to AI. A</p>
<p>significant gap we find between men and women in how they</p>
<p>use (or don’t use) generative AI in their personal and</p>
<p>professional lives is especially worth addressing. As Alondra</p>

<p>Knowledge workers use generative AI tools more in their jobs and in
their personal lives than people in manufacturing or service roles.</p>
<p>When it comes to organizations’ likelihood to embed AI into their
processes by the end of this year, knowledge sector respondents are more
confident in their employers’ implementation (42%) than people working
in manufacturing (28%) or service capacities (26%). Experience gaps
within organizations with generative AI could lead to increased
capability gaps over time, which, concerningly, could result in
increased workplace and labor market inequality.</p>

tha</a>t workers are the best placed people to identify generative AI

<p>parties might be more connected to create more usable technology:</p>

<p>close to first-class citizens in the discussion, but [they] should
be. I</p>
<p>think that's the next battle to fight.”</p>
<p>There are three primary reasons why organizations see better results
when they involve their workers and managers in discussions about
technology planning and implementation:</p>
<p>01 Workers can help identify the promising use cases. Educational
tech</p>
<p>company Skillsoft, for example, has taken a mor<a
href="https://www.charterworks.com/how-to-balance-bottom-up-and-top-down-ai-adoption/">e
bottom-up approach</a> to generative AI adoption, allowing each
department to identify use cases, rather than having IT or management
tell each department what would be most useful for them. This
decentralized approach yielded applications in marketing, engineering,
product, legal, and more. Asana</p>
<p>has tak<a
href="https://www.charterworks.com/ai-is-the-worst-itll-ever-be-so-its-a-great-time-to-experiment/">en
a similar approach and cr</a>eated Slack channels where employees can
share new promising uses.</p>
<p>02 Workers can help identify how new technology will impact their
workflow. Years ago, Marriott launched an app in five cities to boost
productivity by telling housekeepers the order in which to clean hotel
rooms. Rather than help housekeepers, however, the new app sent</p>
<p>them on a “wild-goose chase,” as one union spokespers<a
href="https://fortune.com/longform/unions-workplace-technology/">on told
Fortune.</a> The app directed cleaners from one room to the next, even
if it meant switching floors, moving to different wings of the building,
and skipping over rooms in need of cleaning on the same floor in the
same wing. Workers reported feeling less efficient and were increasingly
worried that they wouldn’t finish their work on time. Housekeepers
concluded that “‘engineers designed this thing working with management,
but</p>
<p>they didn't talk to us,’” say<a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-ballantyne-b292304/">s Amanda
Ballantyne, dir</a>ector of the AFL-CIO Technology Institute.</p>
<p>Disruptions <a href="https://charterworks.com">Charter</a> 22</p>
<p>03 Workers can help identify how new technology will impact
product</p>
<p>and service quality. A Las Vegas casino had plans to upgrade the
way</p>
<p>its customers ordered, by allowing them to select drinks directly</p>
<p>through slot-machine interfaces. To management, this seemed like
a</p>
<p>good idea. To the casino’s cocktail servers, it raised the question:
What</p>
<p>happens when a customer switches slot machines or games? “Slot</p>
<p>players are superstitious,” says Ben Begleiter. “If you're playing
a</p>
<p>particular slot and you don't hit on the first or second spin, you
might</p>
<p>get up and move.” Cocktail servers know who they’re looking for
when</p>
<p>delivering a drink because they interacted with the customer
while</p>
<p>taking their order and can recognize them. If that first step were to
be</p>
<p>replaced by a machine, servers would have a harder time locating</p>
<p>customers—and flagging who should no longer be served alcohol.
The</p>
<p>new system also reflected “a fundamental misunderstanding of the</p>
<p>job,” says Begleiter. “The server…is the person who makes you
feel</p>
<p>comfortable, who makes you feel welcomed. Reducing that to the</p>
<p>person who brings you a drink is dehumanizing.”</p>
<p>When companies keep discussions about technology between</p>
<p>executives and engineers, they miss key sets of information:
workers’</p>
<p>on-the-ground experiences and ideas for improvement. That</p>
<p>experience can be valuable for identifying high-value applications
of</p>
<p>the technology, but also for identifying the downstream problems it
will</p>
<p>likely encounter when practically applied. “[Workers are] not
just</p>
<p>experts in the content of their work, they actually know what tools
work</p>
<p>best for what jobs,” says Ballantyne. “They're the
troubleshooters.</p>
<p>They're the people who figure out how to adapt technology to a
[Workers are] not just specific workplace.”</p>
<p>experts in the content</p>
<p>of their work, they Workers, managers, and leaders need to act as
partners in determining</p>

as one side or the other, because ultimately,</p>

enterprise,” says Aaron</p>

<p>An impressive 59% of individual contributors we surveyed indicate
that they feel empowered to raise concerns or point out problems related
to generative AI at their organization. However, slightly less than half
said that they believe that their interests will be well-represented
when it comes to generative AI adoption at their company. Some are
comfortable speaking up but don’t believe that their concerns will be
meaningfully acted on. Others say they intend to act, but are waiting to
see whether or how their employer will proceed with the technology, such
as this participant: “I plan to raise questions or concerns regarding
the usage of AI if and when it happens.”</p>

<p>Managers and individual contributors alike want to help shape
their</p>
<p>organizations’ approach to AI adoption, according to Charter’s
survey.</p>
<p>Here are frameworks for ensuring that happens:</p>
<p>For development:</p>
<p>Solicit input from primary users. AI tools should not be designed</p>
<p>without input from their primary users. “It's not that an AI engineer
can</p>
<p>come along and solve some problem by themselves,” says
Princeton’s</p>
<p>Russakovsky. “There are so many decisions that go into building an
AI</p>
<p>system for something, and the people who are most qualified to
make</p>
<p>those decisions are the current domain experts.”</p>
<p>Casetext is a promising example of this. The legal AI company
employs</p>
<p>attorneys and AI experts to design products tailored to lawyers’
needs.</p>
<p>It then beta tests those products with law firms before releasing
them</p>
<p>publicly.</p>
<p>Companies designing AI systems for specific industries would do
well</p>
<p>to adopt a similar approach. “At a high level, talk to the people,”
says</p>
<p>Nelson, of the Institute for Advanced Study. “I just would love us to
get</p>
<p>to a place where we would take one more step when we're dealing
with</p>

<p>summarize their meeting notes and action items. Companies looking to
capitalize on the newest developments in AI should ask employees for
their ideas on where to start. “Ask them where they see opportunities,
ask them where they see challenges—and figure out whether anything on
the market actually solves for those,” says Bell. “If the answer to that
is no, chances are that these technologies are going to be met with some
resistance.” There are many ways to source that input, including through
worker councils, employee surveys, and focus groups.</p>
<p>Opt for a greater level of worker control over the technology.
Another factor in whether or not employees welcome AI in their jobs is
their “ability to have some level of control over it,” explains Bell. In
the</p>
<p>Partnership on AI’<a
href="https://partnershiponai.org/paper/ai-and-job-quality/">s AI and
job quality report, her t</a>eam writes about customer service agents in
India who use an AI software program that offers real-time coaching,
assesses their performance, and assists them with certain tasks. At some
companies, agents are told to treat the AI alerts as suggestions, rather
than requirements. Agents at other companies, however, were told to
closely follow the AI’s recommendations. “Both groups recounted
instances where they judged the AI to be incorrect in its
recommendations,” according to the report, “but the group empowered to
deploy their judgment on calls or in chats felt more autonomy and
control over the quality of the service they provided.”</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, telephone operator was one of the most</p>
<p>common jobs for young American women. But mechanical</p>
<p>switching rendered that role obsolete. Patented in 1891, the</p>
<p>automatic telephone exchange was gradually adopted across the</p>
<p>country over the following decades, replacing human operators in</p>
<p>the process. The job prospects for future generations of young</p>
<p>American women weren’t worse off, according t<a

<p>complemented the work performed by high-skilled workers, who</p>
<p>spend more of their time on nonroutine tasks that draw on</p>
<p>creativity and problem-solving skills. Because computers</p>

ability to memorize that amount of information is a skill—one that has
been devalued over the past decade by the rise of digital maps. Digital

<p>08 Frameworks for ensuring</p>
<p>that more workers see</p>
<p>benefits from AI</p>
<p>Benefits of AI are real, workers say–though those benefits may not be
evenly distributed without intervention.</p>

<p>Among those who have used generative AI in their work, the main</p>
<p>benefits that individual contributors report experiencing include,
in</p>
<p>order: time savings, higher-quality work, generating new ideas,
and</p>
<p>lower stress. Respondents wrote:</p>
<p>“AI can help take over some of the more common and repetitive</p>
<p>administrative tasks I do on a daily basis. There is worry about AI
taking over jobs, but with me, AI should be very helpful in streamlining
my processes, making them more accurate, and giving me time to work on
other tasks.”</p>
<p>"I'm confident that AI will not replace my job, as a computer
will</p>
<p>never make the creative leaps humans can, and I like that it saves me
time so I can do more things."</p>
<p>Managers’ experiences are similar, though they are more likely to</p>
<p>report AI being useful in their development of new ideas (55%</p>
<p>compared to 38% for non-managers, who may have less</p>
<p>encouragement to be creative).</p>

<p>According to an August surve<a

<p><a
href="https://news.linkedin.com/2023/september/LinkedIn0">LinkedIn,
“</a>AI is seen as a way to unlock fresh opportunities for work-life
balance and skill enhancement.” Workers surveyed expect AI to open up
free time for them that they plan to use to improve work-life balance
(45%), focus on tasks they enjoy more (44%), learn new skills (39%), and
strengthen their professional networks (30%).</p>
<p>More than half of all respondents in Charter’s study agree or
strongly agree (54%) that “I am excited about the prospect of using
generative AI as part of my day-to day-work.” We saw widespread interest
in the supplementary benefits that AI can provide to augment human
labor. In the words of survey respondents:</p>
<p>“It may be able to help make jobs easier, but not necessarily
replace</p>
<p>human opinion and judgment.”</p>
<p>“My organization could limit the use of AI, and only have
employees</p>
<p>use it as a tool and not a replacement. The employees should
still</p>
<p>review everything in case there is something that the AI did that</p>
<p>was incorrect."</p>
<p>“AI cannot do what I do!”</p>
<p>Causes for concern:</p>
<p>This enthusiasm isn’t evenly distributed, however (see “Consider who
gets to disrupt and who will be disrupted”). And enthusiasm also doesn’t
negate significant concerns we find across respondent groups that
increased AI usage in their industries will have the following
effects.</p>

<p>In response to the question “What are you concerned about in your
industry</p>
<p>from increased AI usage?” one respondent had this to say about how
their</p>
<p>employer could help address their data privacy questions:
"Implementing</p>
<p>proper accountability measures and monitoring the machines' behavior
can</p>
<p>help to alleviate concerns."</p>
<p>Bias considerations:</p>
<p>We also find substantive concerns that generative AI can “create</p>
<p>biased opinions,” in the words of one survey participant, based on
the</p>
<p>flawed existing material that AI tools are trained on. Some 17%
of</p>
<p>surveyed workers and managers indicated that they’re concerned</p>
<p>about bias and discrimination in their industry from increased AI</p>
<p>usage.</p>

<p>inappropriate recommendations, which also helps inform future
suggestions.</p>
<p>AI can also be used to mitigate biases. Consider linguistics software
company Textio, which uses natural language processing and machine
learning to detect non-inclusive language in job postings, performance
feedback, and more. Moonhub, an AI startup, has an AI agent that
recruiters can work with to find promising candidates. The tool flags
potentially biased searches and helps identify ways to find more</p>
<p>diverse candidates<a

according to TIME.</a></p>
<p>Displacement fears:</p>
<p>Our research finds that individual contributors (58%) are more likely
to be concerned about job loss or replacement from increased AI usage in
their industry compared to managers (46%). This difference could reflect
less lucrative employment alternatives for non-managerial workers.
(Though, as Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, and Simon</p>

<p>When we asked, “When you think about how generative AI might impact

<p>“I think it has the ability to make my job obsolete, along with

<p>“Generative AI will be able to run and process payroll, as well

<p>It’s critical that executives seek details from their workers about

<p>Recognize that discourse around AI can be exclusionary,</p>
<p>and set a more inclusive tone.</p>
<p>“There's a fear and mystique around it that's being maintained,
whether</p>
<p>that's deliberate or not,” says Princeton’s Russakovsky. “There's</p>
<p>definitely a sense of an inner circle versus others.” If left
unchecked,</p>
<p>technological gatekeeping will prevail, with effects that can be</p>
<p>detrimental to worker self-determination and financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>When communicating about AI, use approachable, inclusive
language`</p>
<p>Y Avoid using AI/machine-learning jargon and explain concepts</p>
<p>simply instead to prevent exclusion. Instead of saying: "Our new NLP
classifier model utilizes a convolutional neural network architecture to
analyze text data,” try:</p>
<p>"Our new system uses artificial intelligence to categorize text.</p>
<p>The AI looks for patterns in the text to learn which language is
associated with different categories. This can help us tag customer
feedback by topic more efficiently."</p>

<p>“Ask for input and confirm exactly how the process will affect
our</p>
<p>positions and departments.</p>
<p>“Provide more education to all employees.</p>
<p>“Have an open discussion about goals” for the technology-</p>
<p>“Publish goals for AI use.”</p>
<p>Frame AI usage in terms of raising the quality of work and workers’
autonomy, instead of efficiency and cost-cutting.</p>
<p>There is benefit in talking about AI in terms of its contributions to
work quality, not just higher productivity. People who are using AI in
their work already see such enhancements to their work product, with 46%
of relevant respondents to our survey noting “higher-quality work” as
one outcome they’ve experienced.</p>
<p>AI can also allow employees to complete tasks more independently,
giving them access to information and strengthening their sense of
autonomy and purpose. In contrast, when the benefit of AI tools is
described as increased productivity, it reinforces the commoditization
of labor and short-term financial logic that fewer workers could be
necessary.</p>

Anton Korinek, a pr</a>ofessor in economics and business at the</p>
<p>University of Virginia, told us: “One potential upside of generative
AI is</p>
<p>that it seems to help lesser-skilled workers more than

<p>workers, thereby reducing inequality among workers.<a

<p>One potential downside to this is that generative AI could devalue
the</p>
<p>expertise of many workers. MIT economist David Aut<a

gave</a></p>
<p>the example of London cab drivers (mentioned earlier) to illustrate
this</p>

<p>right?’ But, no, actually, it doesn't. It doesn't make anyone an
expert</p>
<p>driver. [Waze] has the expertise.” By devaluing expertise, generative

<p>communicating with intent, advance notice, and clarity:</p>
<p>“Here are the tasks that we think are most likely to be quickly</p>
<p>transformed by generative AI. We bet that you have additional ideas
and places where we might also trigger that transformation, and we
welcome you to bring those forward as well.</p>
<p>The first thing we are going to do is train you for that very
specific transformation, those tasks that are going to change.</p>
<p>And then the next thing we are going to do is open up this broader
conversation inside our company about the larger shifts that are likely
to happen. We're going to welcome that discussion. We're not going to

<p>“Hinton says that, and people go with that. Nobody tested this</p>

<p>Instead of replacing radiologists, those tools have augmented
their</p>

<p>10 Methodology</p>
<p>This is an original research and reporting project to better
understand the attitudes, concerns, and desires of workers around the
adoption of AI tools in their workplaces. Charter’s research and
editorial teams gathered three key information sources for this
playbook:</p>
<p>1. Literature review:</p>
<p>Our exploration of relevant articles and studies can be found in the
reading list in the appendix.</p>
<p>2. Expert interviews:</p>
<p>We conducted in-depth interviews with a range of practitioners, labor
economists, research scientists, organizers, and others to help
contextualize what’s known and unknown about AI in modern workplaces,
including lessons from past technological transformations. Our
conversations with many such experts during the</p>
<p>cours<a

<p>3. Survey research:</p>
<p>Charter, with a grant from Innovation Resource Center for Human</p>
<p>Resources, used the Glimpse human response platform to conduct an</p>
<p>online survey of 1,173 individuals between August 6 and August
26,</p>
<p>2023.</p>
<p>The survey was administered using a non-probability-based sample,</p>
<p>and quotas were used to ensure that non-managers represent</p>
<p>approximately 50% of respondents. Participants included
individuals</p>
<p>who are paid hourly as well as salaried workers. Individuals opted in
to</p>
<p>participate and were compensated at an industry standard rate.</p>
<p>The overall sample features representative geographic, ethnic,
and</p>
<p>age diversity. We did not rebalance the respondent sample to be</p>
<p>reflective of the US population in regards to gender3. As the

<p>“Clerical positions, for which women are overrepresented, are</p>
<p>considered one of the roles most susceptible to automation by</p>
<p>generative AI, according to a recent report from the
International</p>
<p>Labour Organization."</p>
<p>Respondents were evenly distributed across the knowledge,</p>
<p>manufacturing, and service sectors of the US economy. Researchers</p>
<p>reviewed all responses for quality control. We also used generative
AI</p>
<p>through Glimpse and ChatGPT Plus Advanced Data Analysis to</p>
<p>confirm themes we identified from aggregate data and open-ended</p>
<p>responses.</p>
