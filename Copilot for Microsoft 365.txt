In addition, Microsoft offers a unique, industryleading customer Copilot Copyright Commitment. This commitment extends Microsoft's existing intellectual property indemnity support to commercial Copilot services and builds on Microsoft's previous AI customer commitments. Specifically, this means that if a third party sues a commercial customer for copyright infringement for using the Microsoft Copilot offerings or the output they generate, Microsoft will defend the customer and pay the amount of any adverse judgments or settlements that result from the lawsuit if the customer used the guardrails and content filters built into the products.
