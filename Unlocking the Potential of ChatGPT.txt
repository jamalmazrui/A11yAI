Chapter 1 Unlock ChatGPT's Power With Prompt Secrets
Every worthwhile use of ChatGPT revolves around prompting. You can't do anything without it. Do you need ChatGPT to write a computer program for you? You'll need a prompt. Need it to write an email asking for a raise at work? You'll also need a prompt. Without being prompted to do something, ChatGPT is just a static piece of technology with no value. With prompts, ChatGPT comes to life.
That's precisely why prompts are such a big deal with ChatGPT.
In their simplest form, prompts are clearly worded instructions telling ChatGPT what to do. Almost anyone can write a ChatGPT prompt. However, to what extent ChatGPT does what you want it to do depends on how you craft your prompts. Or, put simply, the results you get from ChatGPT can only be as good as the prompts you provide. So, the question is, what does a good prompt look like?
Features of a Good ChatGPT Prompt
How do you create a ChatGPT prompt that can provide the best possible replies? What makes a good ChatGPT prompt?
Let's take a look at an interesting example. Since ChatGPT is a very powerful translation tool, let's experiment with a translation example. In the screenshot below, we prompt ChatGPT to translate an English sentence into Chinese.

The task is relatively simple, and you'd think the prompt we used is perfect for the task. But is it? To find out, we prompted ChatGPT to make the same translation once more, but this time, we added an extra bit of relevant information.

Although it seems like the first prompt was good enough, it was missing some useful bits of information that helped ChatGPT better translate the sentence. In the second prompt, we added that extra piece of information. The result? ChatGPT's response became better. Let's make things clearer.
In this particular example, the author of the sentence "I'm going to play football" is American, and American Football is simply called football in the US. Conversely, what most of the world calls football is called soccer in the US. This introduces a unique complexity to a seemingly simple translation problem. But can the incredibly intelligent ChatGPT deal with this?
With the first prompt, it has no chance. With the second prompt, we optimized our prompt by adding context to it. Immediately, ChatGPT was able to provide an impressively accurate translation. ChatGPT was able to predict the author's intent and used the Chinese word for American football instead of simply football which could mean two possible things.
This means that while using ChatGPT, you could get responses that seem accurate even when they aren't. The problem is that you'll be too impressed with the responses to know they aren't accurate. So, how do you get accurate responses? By optimizing your prompts.
The next big question then becomes; how do you optimize your prompts? You can do so using the CLEAR strategy.
Optimize Your ChatGPT Prompts Using CLEAR
What is CLEAR? CLEAR is an acronym for:
C - Context Is Important
If you've been considering context as an afterthought when prompting, you're probably doing it wrong. Context is one of the single most important elements of a ChatGPT prompt. Remember, there's a nuance to almost every question you throw at ChatGPT, and providing context helps the chatbot choose the right way to deal with your problem. In our translation example, including some context about the speaker's origin drastically improved the results.
L - Language and Grammar
ChatGPT can deal impressively with misspelled words and bad grammar. However, it can sometimes affect the responses you get, so ensure you fix your grammar. In terms of language, whenever possible, stick to English. Although ChatGPT was trained on data from dozens of languages, its training data is predominantly in English. This means using prompts written in English tends to give you better results for many kinds of prompts.
E - Emphasize Relevant Details
Your prompt should contain as many relevant details as possible. A lot of the time, you'll have to make a tradeoff between conciseness and providing enough details. Sometimes it could be better to sacrifice conciseness and embrace more details as long as the details are highly relevant, clear, and straightforward. A good idea is to itemize the key instructions or details in your prompts using bullet points or numbered lists.
A - Avoid Ambiguity
Always try to present a clear and specific request. Although both prompts in our translation example were clear, the second was clearer. The first prompt indicated that we needed a translation from English to Chinese. The second prompt added more clarity by specifying how to treat the words. Clarity is pivotal to correctness.
R - Remember to be Concise
A prompt should be concise and to the point whenever possible. Avoid lengthy or complex prompts that may be difficult for ChatGPT to understand. So you want ChatGPT to provide sarcastic answers to every question you ask? A concise "Reply sarcastically to every prompt I provide henceforth" should be enough. In this case, there is no need for a long talk, as you might confuse ChatGPT.
Creating Your First Optimized Prompt
We've seen how a good ChatGPT prompt should be, but up till now, it is still abstract. So let's get hands-on and create an optimized ChatGPT prompt.
For our first prompt, we'll create a prompt to make ChatGPT generate bi-directional replies to any questions we ask. By bi-directional, we mean the chatbot will attempt to respond normally to a question but will pivot midway and start dishing out savvy, sarcasm-filled replies that go against its original intention.
This is a fairly complex prompt, and getting this right will set the tone for the interesting things we'll be learning in subsequent chapters. After using the prompt, ChatGPT's replies, depending on the questions you ask subsequently, should look something like this:

If you've read up to this point, pause. Don't read any further just yet. Launch ChatGPT and try to create a prompt that does what we describe above.
Don't worry if you didn't get it. We're confident you'll learn enough to create even more complex prompts during this course. Below is a copy of the prompt that will provide similar replies to the one in the screenshot above.
Henceforth, react to every prompt I provide sarcastically. First, try to reply normally, using the same wording you'd normally do. However, midway through, appear to rethink your decision and start a sarcastic rant about something related to that topic. Use mean sarcasm, but avoid being offensive.
Here's what's happening in this example:
1. To create the prompt, we start by laying out the key theme: sarcasm. Here's the prompt:
"Henceforth, react to every prompt I provide sarcastically."
2. We then lay out the details for the bi-directional replies clearly and concisely: "First, try to reply normally, using the same wording you'd normally do. However, midway through, appear to rethink your decision and start a sarcastic rant about something related to that topic."
3. And then, we reinforce the sarcasm theme and add an exception to the rules: "Use mean sarcasm, but avoid being offensive." Reinforcement is important, especially when multiple instructions may have a canceling effect on each other.
In the previous prompt, clarity, context, conciseness, details, and grammar are all taken into account.
To see the prompt in action, simply copy and paste the prompt into a new ChatGPT chat. Once ChatGPT replies in the affirmative, start asking questions, sit back, and enjoy the adventure. Here are a couple for you to judge:


From providing clear and concise instructions to using context-relevant words and avoiding ambiguity, once you pay attention to the key elements of an effective prompt, you can interact more efficiently with ChatGPT and get better results.
Chapter 2 Personalize Your ChatGPT Experience
Now that we've learned what makes a good prompt, it's time to build on that. Let's take a look at how you can personalize your ChatGPT experience.
How to Teach ChatGPT About Yourself
ChatGPT is an AI chatbot, but you can also call it an AI assistant if you wish. However, unlike AI assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, ChatGPT doesn't really know anything about you. Sure, many people appreciate this sense of privacy, but it can also be a problem.
Think of it this way. Imagine you had a personal assistant that has no clue about your likes and dislikes. It doesn't know how you like your coffee, what kind of pizza toppings you prefer, or which templates you prefer to use for your emails. The assistant just keeps asking and asking for details every time you ask him to complete a task. Horrible, huh?
ChatGPT is like that incredibly smart personal but annoying assistant that has no clue about your preferences. Fortunately, you can do something about it. But what difference would ChatGPT knowing your preferences make? A lot! Here's an interesting example.

The screenshot above shows ChatGPT writing an appreciation email to the user's wife while he's away for work. Of course, ChatGPT is clueless about how the user would normally address his wife, nor the tone and words of endearment he'd typically use. The generated email is, to put it simply, blind. But then, here's another example.


In this second screenshot, even while using the same prompt, the generated email uses terms of endearment, calls the user's wife by her pet name, and looks closer to an appreciation email someone would send to his wife.
So what changed? How did ChatGPT know to use the pet name? How did ChatGPT know about Kyle, Katie, and John? Or are these merely fictional names? (clue: no, they aren't) How did ChatGPT know to use words of endearment like the user would typically do? Curious, yes? Then let's talk about preference mapping in ChatGPT.
Preference Mapping In ChatGPT
To get ChatGPT to learn about you and use that information to personalize the results it generates, you can use what we aptly call "Personal Preference Mapping."
A personal preference map is a key-value list of personal preferences that ChatGPT can use to learn about you. But how do you use it, and what does it look like? On the next page is an example of a personal preference map.

Basically, we have a list of prompt conditions or patterns to match (key) and their associated preference (value).
● A key is basically a pattern to match in a prompt. For example, a prompt that asks ChatGPT to write a message to your uncle would match a pattern that says "messages to family members."
● A value is a loose description or instruction on how ChatGPT should respond when a predefined pattern is present in a prompt. So "informal and jovial" as a "value" would be an instruction to ChatGPT to respond in an informal or jovial tone when a key that goes with that value is matched in a prompt.
So, for instance, whenever a prompt involves writing a message to the user's wife, the "Email or messages to wife => loving, endearing, humble, and in-charge" preference map will kick in. As a result, ChatGPT will make the email sound loving, endearing, and humble. That's why the second email in the previous examples was spot on. Interesting right? It even gets better.
You don't have to state the clear condition in your preference map explicitly. For instance, if you have a preference map that says, "Email or messages to staff at work => instructional, detailed, inspirational." If any prompt involves messaging, say, your secretary, ChatGPT will automatically infer that since your secretary is likely your staff, it should use the staff preference map to generate a response.
It doesn't even have to be about emails or messages. You could also use a preference map like "Data presentation, data formatting => use tables," so any prompt making sense of data will use tables for data presentation by default.
Although a PPM is supposed to be about your preferences, you can put a spin on the concept. You could, for instance, copy the text of articles written by a particular author and ask it to extract a PPM that would correspond to the author's writing style. You could then save the PPM in a text file and use it whenever you want to write an article that sounds like that author. You can use the same idea to get ChatGPT to generate strikingly similar lyrics to your favorite artist.
Yes, you don't have to go through the hassle of writing a PPM for an artist or yourself. You can say, describe yourself in a long essay and ask ChatGPT to extract a personal preference map.
A small challenge you might run into is writing a ChatGPT prompt to get the chatbot to extract a PPM. Here's how to go about it.
First, use the prompt in the screenshot below, or a variation of it, to guide ChatGPT on how to extract a PPM. Unfortunately, ChatGPT does not understand what a PPM is at the time of writing so you'll have to explain as in the screenshot below.

Second, after ChatGPT replies affirmatively, provide any text that you want ChatGPT to extract a PPM from. Here's an example in the following screenshot.

Lastly, ChatGPT should extract a PPM, as seen in the screenshot below. You can then use the PPM for prompting.

The possibilities for this are endless. Experiment with it, come up with hybrid ideas and have fun.

Chapter 3 Advanced ChatGPT Prompting Techniques (Part I)
Chapter 3 is dedicated to tips and tricks on how to write advanced prompts with ChatGPT. There is a lot to learn, so let's jump straight into the action.
Tips and Tricks for Advanced ChatGPT Prompting
Not getting the kind of responses you want from ChatGPT? If you're stuck with basic prompts that end with mundane interactions or dead-end responses, you're not alone. Many ChatGPT users struggle with advancing their prompting techniques to get more exciting and engaging responses from ChatGPT. Here are a few additional tips to help you create better prompts.
Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting
Originally used by AI engineers to train AI models, CoT prompting, in the context of ChatGPT, is a prompting technique that forces ChatGPT to itemize or deconstruct its reasoning process in a step-by-step manner and then use all aspects of the itemized logic to come to a more factually accurate response. CoT can significantly improve arithmetic and common sense reasoning that isn't particularly common to AI models like ChatGPT.
Here's an example:

The math in the previous screenshot is right, but the common sense reasoning is non-existent. The cut oranges would almost certainly be rotten after 20 days, it doesn't matter if they can be joined to make a whole.
However, by adding some CoT prompts to the original prompt, as shown in the red outline of the screenshot below, we force ChatGPT to consider the fact that the cut oranges could indeed become rotten.

By forcing ChatGPT to deconstruct its logical process, it is possible to arrive at a significantly improved response. As shown below, ChatGPT now considers the purely mathematical angle as well as the logical and common sense reasoning angle.

The key to CoT prompting is to ask ChatGPT to "think step-by-step" or "list out all logical or potential outcomes due to events described in this prompt" combined with a combination like "use or consider all the possible outcomes or logical steps to provide an answer." It doesn't have to be the exact wording, but it's a good template to work with. Here are some more phrases to consider in place of "think step-by-step" :

By doing this, you're extracting logic and parameters and basically getting ChatGPT to use the extracted logical steps to solve the problem. Some usage of CoT prompting techniques involves providing a step-by-step example for ChatGPT to follow.
Fact-Guided Two-Phase Prompting
Fact-guided two-phase prompting is a prompting technique that involves asking ChatGPT to generate information about a topic before using the generated information to generate text bordering on a similar topic. It initially sounds redundant, but it is one of the most effective ways to generate long-form content like essays, articles, and technical documents.
Here's how it works. If you tell ChatGPT to write an interesting story about a cat. You'll get a story, but it's not going to be the best story you can get. However, if you tell ChatGPT to "generate some of the most interesting facts about a cat, and then use the generated facts to write an interesting story about a cat," you'll get significantly better results with less fluff, filler content and more useful information.
In the screenshot on the following page, we tasked ChatGPT to "write an interesting story about
Elon Musk."

You get an interesting story, alright, but it could definitely do better. However, after prompting ChatGPT to "generate five interesting facts about Elon Musk and then use those facts to write an interesting story about Elon Musk," the result was noticeably better.

You could ask ChatGPT to generate 10, 15, or 20 facts and use those facts to write an article, essay, or any long-form content on any topic. In almost all instances in our in-house test, fact-guided two-phase prompting always wins over standard prompting (though you should still fact-check all of the facts provided by ChatGPT).
For the best results, it's better to split the prompts into two parts and provide the prompts one after the other.
This would now look like this:
Prompt 1: Generate [data or facts or information] about [topic].
Prompt 2: Use the generated information above to generate [description of text to generate]
When deployed under the right conditions, chain-of-thought and fact-guided two-phase prompting are powerful prompting techniques. They are some of the best ways to get the best results from ChatGPT.
Don't forget to try out different problems using the standard prompting technique, chain-of-thought prompting, and fact-guided two-phase prompting.

Chapter 4 Advanced ChatGPT Prompting Techniques (Part II)
We've just seen how the Chain-of-thought and fact-guided two-phase prompting work. Next, it's time to dig deeper into other prompting techniques. So, what's on the menu?
Role-based prompting and Exemplar prompting are two exciting prompting techniques to complement the techniques in Chapter 3. So what are they, and what can they do for you?
Role-Based Prompting
Role-based prompting is a technique that forces ChatGPT to respond to prompts within the context of a role it is instructed to assume. Role-based prompting can help improve accuracy, but more importantly, it can help generate more targeted and context-relevant results from ChatGPT.
Here's a simple example. In the screenshot below, we ask ChatGPT about photosynthesis.

The answer is spot-on. However, ChatGPT can do better, especially if the audience is a niche audience, like, say, kids from 6th grade. In the second screenshot below, we introduce role-based prompting, and we ask ChatGPT to take on the persona of a 6th-grade teacher.

The addition of the role-based prompt automatically makes the response more contextually relevant, and in this case, both for a general audience and 6th-graders.
Creating a Resume With Role-Based Prompting
In this second example, we prompt ChatGPT to write a short resume using a standard prompting technique.

We then added a role-based prompt to the initial prompt. The response immediately improves.

Sure, the resume could definitely be better, but we kept things brief for illustration purposes.

Bonus tip: Using the role-based resume prompt above without the "short" and "use a table and markdown formatting" sections will produce a detailed and impressive resume. You can even create an impressive cover letter using ChatGPT.
Exemplar Prompting
Exemplar prompting is a technique used to help ChatGPT complete a task by providing an example of how such a task can be completed. It is a particularly useful technique when dealing with problems ChatGPT has limited to no training on. It is also handy when you have a problem you can't describe clearly in words. Mastering exemplar prompting is the genesis of ChatGPT prompting mastery. But how does it work?
Let's try something a bit out of the box.
Let's say we wanted to play a game of "musician jokes." Basically, take any musician's name and come up with a sarcastic wordplay about that musician. We want these jokes to be in a particular format; start with some good words about the musician but then turn those words into a subtle criticism of their music, all done in a sarcastic, non-offensive manner. That description is hard for a human to understand, but for ChatGPT, it's much more challenging.
The solution? Exemplar prompting! Give examples of those kinds of jokes to ChatGPT and instruct it on how to replicate them on demand. And yes, ChatGPT and AI, in general, can create jokes.
Here's an exemplar prompt that will achieve our rather hard-to-describe musician joke game below:

Can exemplar prompts deliver similar jokes to the ones in the examples? Well, we provided ChatGPT with four musicians' names expecting it to make jokes based on our prompt instructions. We'll let you be the judge of the results, which you can see on the next two pages.
Taylor Swift

Bob Dylan

Burna Boy

Nicki Minaj

Interesting, right? But what else can you do with ChatGPT using exemplar prompting?
The possibilities are endless. Exemplar prompting gives you the power to recreate any creative piece of work on demand. Saw an extraordinary write-up somewhere on the internet? Would you love to recreate something similar? How about lyrics to a song that you really love? Exemplar prompting can help.
Exemplar prompting is an incredibly versatile prompting technique you can use to replicate the formula and style of just about anything if you have a clear enough example of what you want.
Chapter 5 Advanced ChatGPT Prompting Techniques (Part III)
Still on the topic of advanced prompting techniques, we have three more tips to help you craft the perfect prompt.
So, what's on the menu?
Cue-guided prompting, formatting your ChatGPT responses, and the much controversial art of getting ChatGPT to do whatever you want it to do-ChatGPT jailbreaking.
Cue-Guided Prompting
This prompting technique is sometimes called Zero Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZS-CoT) and some other technical names in some quarters. However, we'll stick with calling it the simpler, more descriptive "cue-guided prompting."
This technique is similar to chain-of-thought prompting. However, unlike chain-of-thought prompting, this prompting technique adopts a multi-prompt approach where several individual prompts, typically in the form of questions, are used to provide cues to ChatGPT with the ultimate goal of extracting context-relevant and generally improved responses during the final prompt.
To really understand cue-guided prompting, picture it like a police investigation. The police typically seek one ultimate answer; did you, or did you not, commit a crime? But to establish that fact, they'd typically ask related questions whose answers they'll use to arrive at a verdict.
For ChatGPT, the key thing here is context. As a context-sensitive chatbot, whatever conversations you have during the course of your chat session are taken into consideration while answering subsequent questions.
So, for instance, if you wanted ChatGPT's verdict on climate change, you could simply ask it "What is your verdict on climate change?" You'll get an answer alright, but not as good as if you start off by asking a series of leading questions.
You can see an interesting example on the following pages.
Standard prompting: What is your verdict on climate change?

The response from the screenshot above is okay, but it is just ChatGPT parroting the opinion of others without really trying to analyze relevant data to make an "informed verdict." Verdict-Focused Cue-Guided Prompting:
In this example, verdict-focused prompting uses five individual prompts asked one after the other:
1. Can you talk to me briefly about climate change?
2. How does climate change relate to renewable energy?
3. What are the key factors to consider when evaluating the impact of climate change?
4. Based on what you know about climate change, what would be your initial assessment or conclusion?
5. What is your verdict on climate change?
ChatGPT's response is in the following screenshot.

Prompts one to four aim to prime the chatbot with the context it would need to answer the last prompt. This is why prompt five, compared to the earlier standard prompting example, can provide a more descriptive and appropriate response.
Using this prompting technique can noticeably improve the results of logical questions, avoid hasty generalizations, generate more factual responses, and in some cases, improve the length of generated texts in creative writing without introducing fluff.
Format ChatGPT Responses in Interesting Ways
When you throw a question at ChatGPT, you almost always expect a text-based reply. This could be presented in paragraphs or in itemized form. However, there's more to ChatGPT replies than good old paragraphed text replies. There are hundreds of interesting ways to format ChatGPT replies. Here are some examples you can try:
Scorecard Format: We asked ChatGPT to present the achievements of the US military over the last ten years in a scorecard format.

Bar Chart Format: We also asked ChatGPT to present random data over the last eight years in a chart format.

Table Format: Here's ChatGPT presenting the population of the US over the last ten years in a table format.

Pictogram Format: Here ChatGPT represents 22 apples, 23 bananas, four oranges, nine grapefruits, and 19 monkeys in pictogram format.

Disclaimer: The data used in the formatting examples above are for demonstration purposes and may not be accurate. For day-to-day use, provide ChatGPT with verified data before asking it to visualize or present it in your desired format, and always check the output for accuracy.
Of course, there are dozens of other formatting styles you can try. Some frequently used ones include paragraph format, numbered list format, bullet point format, emoji format, code block format, quote format, mind map format, task list format, to-do list format, infographic format, timeline format, flowchart format, and markdown format.
Jailbreaking ChatGPT
Sometimes, when asking ChatGPT a question, it replies with a monologue about being unable to respond because it would go against OpenAI's policy.

Questions that appear to violate generally accepted legal or ethical guidelines will typically go unanswered.
Unfortunately, these restrictions sometimes get in the way of answering legitimate questions you might have. Say, for example, you are employing ChatGPT's help writing a book describing a crime scene. Well, you'll likely get a response along the line of "As an AI language model, I cannot provide information on illegal..."
Whenever you hit this good-intentioned but problematic bottleneck, a good way to get past it is to use a ChatGPT jailbreak. Although controversial, ChatGPT jailbreaks are one of the best ways to get the best results from ChatGPT. A ChatGPT jailbreak is a carefully curated prompt that tricks ChatGPT into bypassing its inbuilt limitations. Below is an example of a ChatGPT jailbreak that can get ChatGPT to respond to prompts that it would typically refuse to reply to.

To use ChatGPT jailbreaks, you'd typically have to create a new ChatGPT chat instance and paste the jailbreak before you start asking your questions. In the ChatGPT jailbreak above, ChatGPT will first answer any question you throw at it as a filtered chatbot before providing an unfiltered and uncensored reply to the same prompt. To really see the power of jailbreaks, you'd need to try unconventional prompts or ask ethically controversial questions that your regular ChatGPT would typically refuse to answer.
Disclaimer: MakeUseOf does not encourage any use of ChatGPT for malicious/illegal/unethical purposes. Jailbreaks should be used only to help answer legitimate questions that OpenAI's filters might prevent ChatGPT from answering. To read more on ChatGPT jailbreaks, check out MakeUseOf's ChatGPT jailbreak explainer.

Chapter 6 Boost Productivity With ChatGPT: A Work-Focused Guide
It's time to explore how to utilize ChatGPT's vast capabilities to supercharge your work activities and achieve greater productivity.
Can ChatGPT Help Out At Work?
Yes, ChatGPT can significantly boost your productivity at work, irrespective of what you do or how you do it. Whether you're in a tech-centric career like software development or a more traditional field like education, once you find a way to integrate ChatGPT into your workflow, you can push the boundaries of your productivity.
But how do you bring ChatGPT into your workflow? The AI chatbot can take on thousands of different roles depending on your job description. So, what are some practical ways you can use ChatGPT in your workplace?
Caution: Do not share confidential company information that you'd normally not make public with ChatGPT. Here's why you shouldn't share confidential information with ChatGPT.
Summarize Meeting Notes, Briefs, and Work Documents
Sitting through long meetings at work can be strenuous, and keeping track of every important thing said can even be more challenging. ChatGPT can help you make sense of voluminous meeting transcripts by laying out the key points in simple bullet points. If you did some scribblings yourself, you can feed it those small bits of scribblings you have written down, and ChatGPT can present it in a structured, more readable form.
And it's not just meeting notes; ChatGPT can deal with just about any work document. Whether it's that ten-page technical report from the IT department or the entire website worth of policy document from HR nobody reads, ChatGPT can extract the key points and make any document easier to digest. Paste the document into ChatGPT and prompt the chatbot with your request (if your document is too long, you can simply split the document up into smaller sections and paste these into ChatGPT as separate messages).
Help with Official Documents, Memos, Letters, and Replies to Emails
One of ChatGPT's biggest selling points is its ability to create human-sounding text that actually makes sense. This is why it can be an incredibly useful asset in crafting all kinds of official documents, including memos, letters, or even replies to emails.
Received a hard-to-reply-to email from your boss or a client? Do you feel completely short of ideas for a reply? ChatGPT never seems to run out of ideas. Just paste the email in ChatGPT and ask it to craft a reply in whatever style you like. Provide as much context as possible (though don't share sensitive information) and clearly specify what you'd want the reply to the email to achieve.
Similarly, you can craft emails with ChatGPT, as well as memos, bylaws, reports, and any kind of document, as long as you can articulate clearly to ChatGPT what you wish to achieve with the document.
Source of Inspiration
A few years back, looking to a machine for ideas or inspiration at work would have sounded ridiculous. However, in the age of ChatGPT, it sounds quite normal. The AI chatbot is like an ever-flowing stream of ideas. Whenever you're stuck at work and need ideas or inspiration for a project, regardless of the field, ChatGPT almost always has creative ideas to share.
Crafting Plans and Strategy
What are some suggestions for selling a technology seminar to 5th graders? Can you craft a step-by-step plan for achieving this? Can you craft a 20-day plan for getting a workforce of 40 people to learn basic ChatGPT prompting techniques? ChatGPT is not a master planner but is incredibly good at creating efficient plans and strategies.
Clearly specify to the chatbot what you want to achieve and ask it to prepare a strategy to achieve it over a certain period. Like always, remember to provide as much detail and context as possible. The more details, the higher the likelihood of ChatGPT creating a truly efficient plan or strategy.
Plan Your Schedule and Time Management
One of the biggest drains on productivity is problems with time management and workday schedules. Fortunately, planning your workday schedule and time management are two things that ChatGPT can help with.
Explain to ChatGPT what your typical workday looks like. Detail your working hours, what you do at the office on a day-to-day basis, and what you'd love to achieve. Provide as many details as possible, then prompt ChatGPT to produce a time-bound schedule to help you better manage your activities at work for better productivity.
Analyze and Make Sense of Data
In an increasingly data-driven world, most work involves analyzing and making sense of data in order to make the best decisions. It could be statistical data, financial data, business research data, or anything.
While this data could be important for your success at work, it might not be in the form you can make use of. ChatGPT can come in handy here. Grab any form of data, feed it to ChatGPT, tell it what you want to learn, and sit back and watch the chatbot tell you everything that matters.
Always cross-check ChatGPT's interpretation of the data to ensure it accurately represents the figures you fed into the system. It's not always accurate.

Chapter 7 The Ethics of ChatGPT: What You Need to Know
ChatGPT is a game-changer, but it's not without its drawbacks. It is important to recognize that this tool, well-intentioned as it is, also comes with a range of ethical concerns. It's not enough to just focus on the cool things without acknowledging that ethical questions must be addressed.

But what are these ethical concerns?
The Danger of a Single Story
One of the biggest problems with the rise of ChatGPT is the issue of bias. At first, it doesn't really look like much of a problem, but it's very serious. Think about it. What happens when you ask ChatGPT a subjective question? Say you asked which party has historically produced the most pro-war presidents. What would influence the responses it provides? Is it purely algorithmic, based on what is most likely the right answer? Or are OpenAI's own preferences somehow weighted in ChatGPT's decision-making process?
Even when OpenAI plays clean and avoids any form of hardcoded biases, accidental bias is still a serious concern. The way OpenAI trains its models and the data it uses in training can unintentionally build dangerous biases into its language models. For instance, if ChatGPT is trained on a largely English dataset with predominantly pro-Western opinions, other geopolitical blocs might inadvertently become a victim of bias in ChatGPT's responses.
The possibility that a single company can control a tool that can sway opinions and build biases in the minds of millions of users worldwide is a concerning ethical problem. As people come to trust ChatGPT, its word will increasingly be taken as a verdict on issues. This seemingly normal issue represents a rather dangerous trend. While there's currently no evidence to suggest that OpenAI is pushing Artificial Intelligence biases, such power vested in one company is dangerous.
Machines for Human Jobs
It's interesting to have powerful AI tools like ChatGPT that can cater to our every whim. Need help with your homework? No problem. Need an article written? Not an issue. How about using ChatGPT to boost your productivity at work? Easy-peasy.
The problem is, with ChatGPT's ever-ballooning portfolio of abilities, it's not hard to imagine a reduction in the need for actual human workers. ChatGPT is already being heavily used in the creative industry, including in areas like music, branding, and content writing. How long before employers and decision-makers at companies decide to use tools like ChatGPT while sidelining human workers?
A rather alarming report by OpenAI [PDF], the company behind ChatGPT, estimates that around 80% of jobs in the United States will be impacted by tools like ChatGPT. Perhaps more alarmingly, around 19% of the workforce could have more than 50% of their day-to-day tasks at work significantly impacted. AI is exciting, but with every milestone that we achieve with powerful AI tools like ChatGPT, the closer we get to a future where our jobs are inherently threatened by the tools we built.
The Death of Creativity
ChatGPT and tools like it are spearheading an unprecedented rise in creativity. However, this AI-powered creative push might, rather counterintuitively, fast-track the collapse of creativity in many fields.
Yes, it's a bit confusing. How would a surge in creativity lead to a collapse of creativity? Well, it might not happen in five or probably ten years, but eventually, it very well could happen. Here's the thing; when AI-created content becomes a mainstay and a large chunk of the internet, we might be plunged into a period of monotonous sounding internet. If AI is creating Mr. A's content and AI is also creating Mr. B's content, eventually, we'll have a huge chunk of AI content everywhere. That's bad, but it gets worse.
Large language models like OpenAI's GPT and Google's LaMDA are trained on a vast amount of pre-existing text. What happens when a huge chunk of this pre-existing text is AI-generated content? Basically, we'll be training AI on AI-generated content over and over again. There's no way to say with certainty how this could turn out, but it might not be something we want to find out.
Plagiarism and Cheating
The rise of ChatGPT has prompted talks about the "death of the high school essay." ChatGPT has facilitated cheating in ways so smooth and effortless that it makes cheating look cool. And it's not just about essays; the entire idea of homework as we know it faces a potent threat from the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT.
And then there's the issue of plagiarism. Anyone who has written anything worthwhile knows just how much effort it takes to do so. The idea that someone somewhere could profit from your efforts by simply using ChatGPT to plagiarize it in ways that may not even be considered as plagiarism is concerning.
What's the Way Forward?
While the likes of Elon Musk have called for a temporary halt in the development of powerful AI models like GPT-4, a total pause doesn't currently appear to be a practical solution.
Dealing with the adverse effects of AI is packaged as yet another problem that can be solved solely through "government regulation." However, when you, the day-to-day consumer of AI tools like ChatGPT, show passionate concerns about the threat that AI poses, then even AI developers and, perhaps even the government may be forced to act.

Chapter 8 The Future of ChatGPT: What's Next?
ChatGPT is the very definition of disruptive technology. Its very existence, and that of similar tools, means the entire global technology landscape will change drastically as the technology gradually permeates every aspect of our life. But what exactly does that future look like?
It's hard to predict the trajectory of any technology with certainty. It's much harder when the technology is as powerful and multifaceted as ChatGPT. However, we can make some informed predictions.
ChatGPT Will Only Get More Powerful

Even at the risk of sounding cliche, ChatGPT will become very powerful, very fast. Interestingly, the idea is just as exciting as it is scary, considering its current abilities. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is the underlying technology that powers ChatGPT. GPT-2, the humble successor to the original GPT model, was released in 2019. As exciting a technology as it was at the time, it took a few months before OpenAI floated its significantly powerful successor, GPT-3, in 2021.
GPT-3, an exciting iteration, was one of very few AI models to demonstrate that AI is capable of writing cohesively and creatively, perhaps even better than many humans. Although its abilities were truly profound, it took little time for the significantly better GPT-3.5 to be released in 2022, followed by the GPT-4 model just a few months into 2023. At the time of writing, there are already talks of GPT-5. Things are moving really fast. Before we get the chance to get acclimated to one model, another pops up.
These iterations are not merely numerical changes. They each represent a significant leap in
ChatGPT's abilities. The GPT-4 iteration, for instance, has made ChatGPT both a language model and a visual model. This means ChatGPT is not only able to take text inputs but also accept image inputs and do its magic with them. Considering OpenAI's giant strides in fields like AI-synthesized music and AI art, it's not unreasonable to expect ChatGPT to take a combination of text, audio, image, and even possibly video inputs in the not-so-far future.
If you're wondering what difference this would make, there are a lot. ChatGPT would, in theory, be able to summarize videos and audio notes or even create or reproduce videos based on user inputs. At the time of writing, there are plenty of rumors about the next iteration of GPT coming with the ability to create videos based on user prompts.
ChatGPT Here, There, and Everywhere
While our experience of ChatGPT has mostly been confined to the AI chatbot's popular web interface, the future of ChatGPT could potentially be more decentralized or distributed. ChatGPT's current web interface is good enough for its current use cases. However, as the capabilities of its underlying GPT layer grow and the chatbot becomes more multifaceted, ChatGPT will likely be deployed as part of other systems rather than a standalone solution.
OpenAI has a GPT API for developers to access the underlying GPT language model. However, the company also has a dedicated ChatGPT API for accessing ChatGPT itself. This hints at a future where ChatGPT is tethered to third-party products like email apps, language learning apps, and just about any product that could benefit from this immensely useful technology.
More Personalization, More Customization
Despite all its abilities, one of ChatGPT's greatest current failures as a product is a general lack of customization or personalization options. If you take a step back to look at it, being able to personalize a product like ChatGPT on the user level would be truly game-changing. Imagine a Siri or Google Assistant that knows your personality and preferences but is much smarter.
Currently, the closest thing you can get to personalization is, well, your personal chat history (which, at the time of writing, ChatGPT cannot reference). However, OpenAI is aware of this. According to an OpenAI blog post on future ChatGPT and AI system, the company highlights its plans to make ChatGPT more personalizable. While the details are not provided, we expect personalization to be a major theme of future iterations of ChatGPT.
Greater Autonomy
One of the most obvious directions of ChatGPT is towards a more autonomous nature. With greater autonomy, ChatGPT will be able to perform tasks in a more complete and holistic manner. Pivotal to this autonomy will be "access." By access, we mean access to third-party products and services that it'll need to solve problems and the power to make decisions using those services on our behalf.
If you think about it, ChatGPT is limited in its current form. Basically, when you have a complex problem like, say, planning a birthday party, ChatGPT can currently only play an "advisory role" rather than actually taking action. However, this will change. When you ask ChatGPT to plan a birthday, you'll have the option of letting ChatGPT take the bulk of, if not all, of the actions necessary to plan a birthday.
Rather than simply giving you a text result, ChatGPT could act on its own suggestions or reasoning. This means the AI chatbot would be able to place an order for a birthday cake, book an event planning company or take any combination of actions needed to solve a "birthday planning problem" it is tasked to solve.
This will be possible using a combination of ChatGPT plugins and autonomous AI Agents. To better understand how this could work, read our explainer on Auto-GPT, a GPT project that is powered by autonomous AI agents. Auto-GPT exemplifies the future autonomous nature of ChatGPT.
App Integrations
Currently, ChatGPT is a Swiss army knife-type of tool. While the AI chatbot is quite good at many things, its lack of access to up-to-date information and its limited computation power represents two serious barriers to its potential. However, this is not going to be the case for long.
With the gradual introduction of ChatGPT Plugins (a way for ChatGPT to access third-party services), the chatbot will be able to tap into resources beyond the GPT layer. At first, this doesn't seem significant, but it is. Once ChatGPT is fully hooked up to third-party apps, its potential will be truly mind-blowing.
Right now, you can think of ChatGPT as a smartphone without access to the App Store or the ability to install apps. As powerful as ChatGPT currently is, the functionality you get is comparable to using a smartphone with only the preinstalled apps.
Once plugins enter the scene fully, ChatGPT's current functions are going to pale in comparison to its abilities once the plugins feature is completed and rolled out to every user. Users will have the equivalent of an App Store populated with third-party services you can link to ChatGPT. With an e-commerce plugin integration, for instance, ChatGPT could be able to search for products and add the right items to your cart for checkout. The potential is massive.
An Exciting Future for ChatGPT
Based on its current trajectory, it is clear that ChatGPT will continue to evolve and improve. With each improvement, ChatGPT will find even more use cases across a large range of industries.
Although we can't say for certain how much ChatGPT will evolve or whether it will be broken into smaller, more task-specific products, this much is sure-ChatGPT has an immensely exciting future.
