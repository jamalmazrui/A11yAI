How I wrote a book in a day  
(with a little help from Claude)
Claude.ai wrote this book. Or did I? I guess we did it together. 
In July 2024, I was asked to start preparing for a Masterclass prompting I was to give in October. While I had been developing training and inspirational sessions on Generative AI for more than a year now, I wanted this session to be something special. After working on the content and the presentation for several weeks, I felt ready for the dry run, scheduled for two weeks from now.
While I was working on other things, I kept coming back to the session for finetuning - a never-ending story. And while I was experimenting with the different possibilities of the tools, I thought, "Why not try to write a companion book to the session?"  
I was pretty happy with the content and the structure of my presentation, so I decided to see what Copilot for Microsoft 365 could do with it. I went to Word and asked it to create a document based on the presentation. This works fine, but the result... was not really a book, it was more like three pages. Very good as a summary for the presentation, but nothing more. I asked, begged and pleaded with Copilot (yes, we all do that sometimes) to give me more text, more pages, but it couldn't.
While Copilot for Microsoft 365 is really good for everyday tasks, this wasn't it. Copilot Online (the Enterprise version) gave me some variations, as did ChatGPT and Gemini. But I realized that writing a whole book would be quite a lot of work, more than I could handle. Next came Claude.ai. I had experimented with Claude in the past, and I found its results really good, but not necessarily always the best for what I need. Copilot usually gives me really good results, including references and online research, so that's my go-to AI. But this time, I was in for a treat.
I gave Claude the Word document that Copilot had created, and I asked it to write me a book of 14.000 words. After a couple of seconds, I got the following response:
I understand that you'd like me to write an extensive book of about 15,000 words on prompt techniques, based on the Dutch document you provided. This is a rather large task that will require careful planning and execution. I'd be happy to help you with this project, but I think it would be best to approach it in stages. 
Here's how I suggest we proceed:
First, let's outline the structure of the book based on the information in the document.
Then, we can work on expanding each section one at a time.
We'll review and refine each section as we go.
Finally, we'll put it all together and make sure it flows well as a complete book. 
Does this approach sound good to you? If so, I'll start by creating an outline for the book. If you have any specific preferences or additional topics you'd like to include, please let me know.
What followed, was one of my best experiences with Generative AI in the past year. Claude started writing chapter after chapter, and it felt like it knew exactly what I wanted to say. Halfway through, I had to upgrade to a Pro account, but I was too far along to stop at that point (Yes, I know, they got me...).  
 
After about two hours, I had a pretty good draft of a book on prompting that covered everything that's in my Masterclass, and more! I spent another day going through the text, rewriting paragraphs, asking Claude to rewrite what I had written to fit in with the rest, rewriting again, adding details, moving or removing certain parts... 
It took me one day to write a book. One day! If I had to do it alone, I probably wouldn't have gotten past the introduction. I like to write (this very chapter was written without AI), but more than 100 pages? I have written user guides for Office apps in the past, but they usually took more than three weeks to complete. 
This experience shows me the true power of Generative AI: working together, being creative and using the tool to extend that creativity. Yes, this book was written by Claude.ai and me, and I'm proud of the result. I hope you'll have as much fun discovering how to improve your prompting skills as I did writing this ebook.

Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering
1. 	What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective inputs for generative AI tools to produce desired outputs. For information workers using tools like Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, or Gemini, mastering prompt engineering can significantly enhance productivity and the quality of AI-assisted work. 
Poor prompt engineering can lead to suboptimal or even misleading results from AI tools. Examples of bad prompts include vague requests like "Tell me about history," which are too broad and lack specific focus. Overly complex or jargon-filled prompts such as "Elucidate the multifaceted ramifications of socioeconomic disparities on educational attainment" may confuse the AI or result in equally convoluted responses. Biased or leading prompts like "Explain why capitalism is always better than socialism" can produce skewed or unreliable information.  
 
Additionally, prompts that ask the AI to perform tasks beyond its capabilities, such as "Access my personal email and summarize my recent messages," are ineffective and potentially raise privacy concerns. Crafting clear, specific, and well-structured prompts is key to leveraging AI tools effectively.
Key aspects of prompt engineering: 
• It's a skill that can be learned and improved over time
• It bridges the gap between human intent and AI capability
• It's crucial for getting the most out of AI tools in your daily work
2. 	The Anatomy of a Good Prompt
A well-crafted prompt typically consists of several key elements: 
1. Clear Objective: What you want to achieve
2. Context: Relevant background information
3. Constraints: Any limitations or specific requirements
4. Format: The desired structure of the output
5. Examples (when helpful): Illustrations of what you're looking for
Here's an example of a well-crafted prompt: 
 
Create a brief executive summary of the Q2 sales report. Context: Our company sells software solutions. The summary should highlight key metrics, trends, and actionable insights. Format it as 5 bullet points, each no longer than 2 sentences. Example of a good bullet point: 'Q2 sales increased by 15% YoY, driven primarily by our new cloud offering.
3. 	Key Components of Effective Prompts
Effective prompts are the cornerstone of successful interactions with generative AI tools. By incorporating key components such as clarity, specificity, context, and appropriate framing, users can guide AI models to produce more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs across a wide range of applications.

1. Being Too Vague 
Bad: "Give me some ideas for my presentation."
Better: "Suggest 5 key points to include in a 10-minute presentation on improving customer retention for a SaaS company."
2. Overloading with Information
Bad: [A paragraph of detailed company history and current market conditions] Better: Provide context concisely, focusing on what's directly relevant to your request.
3. Neglecting to Specify Format
Bad: "Write about time management techniques."
Better: "Create a numbered list of 7 time management techniques, each with a brief one-sentence explanation."
4. Forgetting to Set Constraints
Bad: "Give me ideas for team-building activities."
Better: "Suggest 5 team-building activities suitable for a remote team of 20 people, each taking no more than 30 minutes."
5. Assuming AI Knows Your Specific Context
Bad: "What should I include in the report?" (Without providing any context) Better: "I'm preparing a quarterly financial report for our startup's investors. What are the 5 most crucial elements I should include?"
5. 	Iterative Prompting
Prompt engineering is a dynamic and iterative process that requires patience and creativity to master. The journey begins with crafting an initial prompt, which serves as your first attempt to communicate your intentions to the AI. This initial prompt is based on your understanding of the task at hand and your expectations of what the AI can deliver. However, it's rare to achieve perfect results on the first try, which is why the iterative nature of prompt engineering is so crucial.
Once you've submitted your initial prompt, the next step is to carefully evaluate the AI's response. This evaluation phase is critical as it allows you to identify areas where the output aligns with your expectations and, more importantly, where it falls short. You might find that the AI misinterpreted certain aspects of your request, focused on irrelevant details, or perhaps didn't provide the depth or specificity you were looking for. This analysis forms the foundation for the next phase of the process.
Armed with insights from your evaluation, you can then refine your prompt. This refinement might involve clarifying ambiguous terms, adding more specific details, or restructuring the prompt to guide the AI's focus more effectively. The refined prompt is then submitted, and the cycle of evaluation and refinement continues. This iterative approach allows you to progressively hone in on exactly what you need, especially for more complex or nuanced tasks. By patiently working through this process, you can guide the AI to produce results that closely align with your vision, even if it takes several iterations to get there.
Here's an example of iteration: 
 
1. Initial: "Give me ideas for increasing employee engagement."
2. Refinement: "Provide 5 specific strategies for increasing employee  	  	engagement in a hybrid work environment, focusing on communication and   	team-building."
3. Further refinement: "For each of the 5 strategies you suggested for employee   	engagement in a hybrid work environment, provide one real-world example of   	a company successfully implementing it."
 
By mastering these fundamentals of prompt engineering, you'll be well-equipped to leverage AI tools effectively in your daily work, enhancing your productivity and the quality of your outputs across various tasks and projects.

1. 	Prompt Priming
Prompt priming involves providing context or examples to the AI before asking your main question. This technique can significantly improve the relevance and quality of the AI's responses.
Zero-Shot Prompting
 
Zero-shot prompting is a technique where an AI is asked to perform a task without being given any specific examples or prior training for that particular task. This approach tests the AI's ability to generalize its knowledge and apply it to new situations. It relies on the AI's broad understanding of language and concepts to interpret the request and produce a relevant response. While challenging, successful zero-shot prompting demonstrates the AI's flexibility and capacity for reasoning across diverse domains.
Example:

 
 
One-Shot Prompting 
One-shot prompting is a technique that enhances AI task performance by providing a single, illustrative example before requesting a similar action. This method offers the AI a clear template to follow. By demonstrating the desired output format or approach once, one-shot prompting helps guide the AI's understanding and improves the accuracy and relevance of its responses. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with specific formats or styles that may not be immediately obvious from the task description alone.
Example:
"Here's an example of how to summarize a business email:
Original: 'Dear team, I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base about the upcoming client presentation. We need to finalize the slides by Friday, run through a practice session on Monday, and deliver the presentation next Wednesday. Please make sure all your sections are complete and proofread by Thursday EOD. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.'
Summary: 'Team needs to complete presentation slides by Friday, practice on Monday, for delivery on Wednesday. Individual sections due Thursday EOD.' Now, summarize the following email in a similar style: [Insert new email text here]"
 
Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting is an advanced technique that leverages multiple examples to guide an AI's comprehension and execution of a given task. By presenting several diverse instances of the desired input-output relationship, this method allows the AI to discern patterns and nuances more effectively.
Few-shot prompting helps the AI grasp the full scope of the task, including potential variations and edge cases. This approach strikes a balance between minimal guidance and extensive training, enabling the AI to generalize from the provided examples and apply the learned concepts to new, similar scenarios with greater accuracy and flexibility.

"I want you to classify customer feedback into categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Here are some examples:
'Your product has revolutionized our workflow!' - Positive
'I've been waiting for a response from your support team for days.' - Negative
'The product works as expected.' - Neutral
 
Now, classify the following customer feedback:
'I'm not sure if this was worth the price, but it does the job.'
'Absolutely terrible customer service! I'm switching to your competitor.'
'The new features in the latest update are game-changing!'
'It's okay, I guess. Nothing special.'"
Note that some AI tools can combine this technique with an uploaded file. So instead of giving a short list as in the previous example, you could refer to a file and ask the AI to do this analysis on a longer list.
Mastering these prompt priming techniques-zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting-can significantly enhance your interactions with AI systems. Each method has its strengths and is suitable for different scenarios, depending on the complexity of the task and the level of guidance required.
As you practice and experiment with these methods, you'll develop a intuitive sense of which approach works best for various tasks, allowing you to leverage AI capabilities more effectively in your personal and professional endeavors.

Additionally, XML-like tags can help improve the clarity of your prompts, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation by the AI and leading to more accurate and relevant outputs.
Within a longer conversation with an AI, using tags can be especially beneficial as they provide clear reference points. This makes it easier for the AI to understand which specific parts of previous exchanges you're referring to, enhancing the coherence and continuity of the dialogue. By consistently using tags throughout a conversation, you create a shared framework that both you and the AI can rely on to maintain context and focus.


4. 	Self-Criticism and Iterative Refinement
Encouraging the AI to evaluate and improve its own responses can significantly enhance the quality of its outputs. This self-reflective approach prompts the AI to critically analyze its initial answers, considering factors such as accuracy, relevance, and completeness. By incorporating this step, users can obtain more refined and precise information. The process may involve asking the AI to doublecheck its facts, consider alternative perspectives, or elaborate on certain points. This iterative improvement cycle not only leads to more accurate responses but also helps in uncovering nuances or details that might have been overlooked initially. Moreover, it mimics human cognitive processes of review and refinement, potentially resulting in more thoughtful and comprehensive answers. Ultimately, this practice can transform the AI from a simple query-response tool into a more dynamic and adaptive assistant capable of producing higher-quality, more reliable outputs.
Example:
"Generate a marketing email for our new productivity app. After generating the email, critically evaluate it for persuasiveness, clarity, and adherence to best practices in email marketing. Then, based on your evaluation, rewrite the email to address any shortcomings you identified."
5. 	Reverse Engineering Prompts
The technique of asking an AI to generate a prompt that would produce a specific type of output is a powerful method for enhancing prompt engineering skills. 
This approach, often referred to as "reverse prompting" or "prompt generation," involves tasking the AI with creating the input that would lead to a desired output. By engaging in this exercise, users can gain valuable insights into the structure and components of effective prompts for particular tasks.
This method can reveal nuances in language, formatting, and context that might not be immediately apparent when crafting prompts from scratch. It's particularly useful for complex or specialized tasks where the ideal prompt structure may not be intuitive. Additionally, this technique can help users understand the AI's "thought process" and how it interprets different prompt elements. As users compare the AI-generated prompts with their own, they can refine their prompt crafting skills, leading to more precise and efficient interactions with AI systems across various applications.
Example:
"Here's a well-written project status update:
[Insert a sample project status update]
What prompt would you give to an AI assistant to generate a similar project status update? Please provide the prompt and explain why each element of the prompt is important."
6. 	Multi-Turn Conversation Design (prompt chaining)
Designing a series of prompts that build on each other is an effective strategy for tackling complex tasks or generating more comprehensive outputs with AI. This approach, also known as "chain prompting" or "prompt chaining," involves breaking down a complex task into smaller, manageable steps, each addressed by a separate prompt. By structuring prompts in this sequential manner, users can guide the AI through a logical progression of thought, simulating a multi-turn conversation.
This method is particularly useful for tasks that require in-depth analysis, creative problem-solving, or the synthesis of multiple concepts. For instance, when creating a comprehensive business plan, you might start with prompts that gather essential information about the business idea, target market, and initial resources. Then, subsequent prompts can focus on developing specific sections of the business plan, such as market analysis, financial projections, and marketing strategies.
This step-by-step approach allows for more nuanced exploration of each aspect of the plan, ensuring that all crucial elements are thoroughly addressed. Moreover, it enables users to review and refine intermediate outputs, ensuring the final result is comprehensive and well-aligned with the overall objective. By employing this technique, users can leverage AI to produce more sophisticated, well-reasoned, and thorough outputs for complex scenarios, while maintaining control over the direction and content of the conversation.
Example 1:
"We're going to create a comprehensive business plan for a new startup. We'll do this in stages. First, ask me a series of questions to gather the necessary information about the business idea, target market, and initial resources. Then, we'll go through each section of the business plan one by one, with you providing guidance and generating content based on my responses."
 
Example 2:
1. "Generate a list of 5 potential topics for our company blog, focusing on    	emerging trends in our industry."
2. "For each of the blog topics you just generated, create a brief outline with   	main points."
3. "Take the first outline and expand it into a full blog post of approximately 800   	words."
4. "Now, generate 5 engaging social media posts to promote this blog post on   	different platforms."
5. 	Prompt Templates for Recurring Tasks
Developing reusable prompt templates for tasks you perform regularly is a strategic approach to streamline your AI interactions and enhance productivity. By creating a library of well-crafted, task-specific prompts, you can save significant time and effort in your day-to-day work with AI systems.

Chapter 10 
Ethical Considerations in Prompt 
Engineering
As AI tools become increasingly integrated into our work processes, it's crucial to consider the ethical implications of their use. This chapter will explore key ethical considerations in prompt engineering and provide guidelines for responsible use of AI in the workplace.
 
1. 	Avoiding Bias and Discrimination
AI models, despite their impressive capabilities, are not immune to biases. These systems can unknowingly perpetuate or even amplify prejudices and stereotypes present in their training data. This phenomenon occurs because machine learning algorithms learn patterns from historical data, which may contain societal biases accumulated over time. 
It's crucial to approach AI-generated content with a critical eye and an understanding of these limitations. You should be aware that AI outputs may reflect and potentially exacerbate existing societal biases related to race, gender, age, or other sensitive attributes.
Additionally, human oversight and intervention play vital roles in mitigating AI bias. By combining AI capabilities with human judgment and ethics, we can work towards more equitable and unbiased outcomes. This approach involves questioning AI-generated results, cross-referencing information from multiple sources, and consistently considering the broader societal impact of AI applications. 
Guidelines: 
1. Be mindful of potential biases in your prompts 
Example of a biased prompt: "Generate a description of a typical successful entrepreneur." 
 
Improved prompt: "Generate diverse examples of successful entrepreneurs, including people of various genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds." 
2. Review and critically evaluate AI-generated content 
Always review AI outputs for potential biases or stereotypes before using  them in your work. 
3. Use inclusive language in your prompts 
Example: Instead of "businessman" or "businesswoman", use "business professional" or "entrepreneur".
4. When dealing with sensitive topics, explicitly instruct the AI to be neutral and factual 
Example: "Provide an objective summary of the current debate on [sensitive topic]. Present multiple viewpoints without favoring any particular stance."
2. 	Ensuring Privacy and Data Protection
When using AI tools, it's crucial to protect sensitive information and respect privacy boundaries. You must be vigilant about the data you input into these systems, as they may store or process information in ways you don't fully control. Be cautious about sharing personal identifiers, confidential business information, or any data that could compromise individual privacy or organizational security.
It's important to understand the privacy policies and data handling practices of the AI tools you use. Some systems may retain inputted data for model improvement, which could potentially expose sensitive information. Always use these tools in compliance with relevant data protection regulations and your organization's privacy guidelines.
Consider anonymizing or generalizing information when possible before inputting it into AI systems. This approach can help maintain privacy while still allowing you to leverage AI capabilities. Additionally, be mindful of the context in which you're using AI tools - certain environments may require extra precautions or may not be suitable for AI assistance at all.
Remember that AI models can sometimes generate detailed outputs based on minimal input, potentially revealing more information than intended. Always review AI-generated content carefully before sharing or acting on it to ensure no unintended disclosures occur. By maintaining a strong focus on privacy and data protection, you can harness the benefits of AI while safeguarding sensitive information.
Guidelines: 
1. Avoid inputting personally identifiable information (PII) into AI tool Instead of using real names or specific details, use placeholders or anonymized data. 
2. Be cautious with confidential business information 
Example of what to avoid: "Analyze our confidential sales data for Q2,  which I'll paste here: [confidential data]" 
 
Better approach: "I need to analyze some sales data. Can you provide a general framework for analyzing quarterly sales trends without me sharing the actual data?" 
3. Understand the data retention policies of the AI tools you're using Some AI services may retain input data for model improvement. Be aware of this when deciding what information to input. 
4. When generating content about individuals, respect their privacy Example: Instead of "Write a detailed profile of our new CEO, John Smith, including his personal background", use "Suggest a format for a professional bio of a new CEO, focusing on career achievements and professional qualifications."
3. 	Maintaining Transparency and Disclosure
When using AI tools, it's crucial to protect sensitive information and respect privacy boundaries. Before engaging with any generative AI service, check your company's policies regarding their use. Understand which specific tools are permitted and for what purposes. Some organizations may have strict guidelines or prohibit certain AI applications altogether. Once you've confirmed compliance, be vigilant about the data you input into these systems.
Remember that some AI services may retain input data for model improvement, so be cautious when deciding what information to share. Avoid inputting sensitive personal identifiers, confidential business information, or any data that could compromise individual privacy or organizational security.
Always use these tools in accordance with relevant data protection regulations and your company's privacy guidelines. By staying informed about both your company's policies and the AI tools' data practices, you can leverage these powerful resources while maintaining appropriate safeguards for sensitive information.
Guidelines: 
1. Disclose AI assistance when appropriate 
Example: In a report footer - "This report was prepared with assistance  from AI language models. All content has been reviewed and verified by  [Your Name]." 
2. Distinguish between AI-generated content and human-created content When collaborating on documents, you might use comments or  	 highlighting to indicate which parts were AI-assisted. 
3. Be prepared to explain your use of AI tools 
Understand how the AI arrives at its outputs so you can explain the process if asked.
4. Don't misrepresent AI capabilities 
Avoid implying that AI can provide authoritative answers on subjects requiring human expertise or judgment.
4. 	Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability
While AI tools can be incredibly helpful, they can also make mistakes or generate inaccurate information. These systems, despite their sophistication, are not infallible. They can produce errors, inconsistencies, or even completely fabricated information - a phenomenon often referred to as "hallucination" in AI contexts. This is particularly common when the AI is asked to operate outside its training domain or when dealing with ambiguous queries.
You should always approach AI-generated content with a critical mindset. Factcheck important information, especially when it relates to critical decisions or sensitive topics. Be particularly wary of AI responses that seem too confident or precise, as this can sometimes mask underlying uncertainties or inaccuracies. It's also important to remember that AI models have knowledge cutoffs and may not be up-to-date with the most recent information. They can sometimes present outdated facts or fail to account for recent developments in rapidly evolving fields.
To mitigate these risks, consider using AI-generated content as a starting point rather than a definitive answer. Cross-reference information with reputable sources, and when in doubt, seek human expert opinion. By maintaining a balanced approach - leveraging AI's strengths while being aware of its limitations - you can maximize the benefits of these tools while minimizing potential pitfalls.
Guidelines: 
1. Always fact-check important information 
Example prompt: "I'm going to use the information you provide in a client  presentation. Please only include facts you're very confident about, and  indicate any areas where you're less certain." 
2. Use AI as a starting point, not the final word 
Treat AI outputs as drafts or suggestions that require human review and  verification. 
3. Be aware of the AI's knowledge cutoff date 
For topics that may have recent developments, include a prompt like:  "Please note that your knowledge might not be up to date. I'll verify any  recent information myself." 
4. Cross-reference AI-generated information with reliable sources Don't rely solely on AI for critical business decisions or sensitive  	 information.
5. 	Responsible Use of AI-Generated Content
As artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize various aspects of our work and daily lives, it is crucial to approach the use of AI-generated content with thoughtfulness and responsibility. The ethical deployment of AI tools requires careful consideration of their broader implications, including their impact on intellectual property, employment landscapes, personal skill development, and environmental sustainability.
Guidelines: 
1. Respect intellectual property rights 
Don't use AI to reproduce copyrighted content without permission. Be  cautious when asking AI to generate content similar to existing works. 
2. Consider the impact on jobs and skills 
Use AI to enhance your work, not to replace critical thinking or creativity.  
Focus on using AI for tasks that free up time for higher-value activities 
3. Maintain your own expertise 
Don't become overly reliant on AI. Continue to develop your own skills and knowledge.
4. Be mindful of the environmental impact 
Large language models require significant computational resources. Use  AI tools judiciously and efficiently.
6. 	Ethical Prompt Engineering in Practice
Ethical prompt engineering is a critical skill in the age of artificial intelligence, where the way we formulate requests to AI systems can significantly impact the outcomes and their ethical implications.While using AI tools, it's essential to craft prompts that not only achieve our desired results but also uphold ethical standards, promote inclusivity, protect privacy, ensure transparency, maintain accuracy, and encourage responsible use.
