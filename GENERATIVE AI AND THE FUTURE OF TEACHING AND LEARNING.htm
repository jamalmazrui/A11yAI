Learning, highlights both the potential benefits and challenges of AI in early
learning, whose application is still emerging. AI innovations address
assessment challenges and improve efficiency in analyzing child-adult
interactions. Technologies help children recognize emotions, and language
support tools aid multilingual learners in classrooms and through distance
learning. Hau stresses the importance of addressing privacy, bias and equity issues
associated with AI in early childhood and notes the need for better technology
solutions to connect parents with care providers.<sup><span style='font-size:

Development, Ethical Use and Education</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:.75pt'>The transition to an AI-integrated workplace requires
comprehensive strategies focused on reskilling, ethical AI deployment, and
proactive workforce planning. This approach ensures AI contributes positively
to economic growth and workforce development, enhancing human capabilities
across all sectors. As AI becomes integrated into various fields, upskilling
the workforce is imperative. Programs that enhance digital and data literacy
and impart AI-specific skills are crucial. Personalized learning approaches,
like those highlighted by Sal Khan<sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:105%'>1</span></sup>,  demonstrate AI’s potential to tailor
education to individual needs and mitigate AI literacy gaps in many
communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:.75pt'>Underrepresented groups often face disenfranchisement during
economic transitions. The Charter Innovation Research Center’s playbook, “Using
AI in Ways That Enhance Worker Dignity and Inclusion.”<sup><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:105%'>2</span></sup> addresses concerns
about these workers. Charter’s research suggests that women, workers of color
and those over 55 could be disproportionately disadvantaged by AI and
automation. A Charter Works survey found that 53% of Black respondents were
concerned about AI replacing their jobs, compared to 39% of White respondents.<sup><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:105%'>3</span></sup> These insights
underscore the need to implement AI in ways that enhance worker dignity and
inclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:6.6pt;
margin-left:.75pt'>Addressing these challenges requires proactive policy
interventions, ethical AI development and enhanced cooperation to ensure
benefits are shared equitably. Educational systems must evolve to provide
AI-relevant skills, promoting continuous learning and adaptability.
Collaboration between businesses, governments, and academia is crucial to
mitigate the adverse effects of automation by supporting displaced workers
through reskilling and establishing robust social safety nets. The goal is to
leverage AI’s transformative potential for broad societal advancement, ensuring
technological progress enriches California’s most vulnerable communities </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.45pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:.75pt'>Higher education institutions play a critical role in
preventing a longterm AI digital divide. It is essential, therefore, to create
the technical preconditions for using AI effectively and to support users in
building the digital literacy and fluency needed to use AI safely and
responsibly. Generative AI presents specific challenges and opportunities in
the workforce, particularly in reshaping high-mobility jobs. These jobs, which
offer livable wages and potential for career advancement without necessarily
requiring a four-year degree, are critical for economic mobility. “Gateway”
jobs, which provide salaries above $42,000 based on experience rather than
degrees, and “Target” jobs, which offer higher salaries and stable positions,
are particularly crucial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.2pt;margin-bottom:8.0pt;
margin-left:.75pt'>The widespread deployment of Credit for Prior Learning (CPL)
can increase the number of workers on path to gateway jobs. Two Vision 2030
projects, the MAPP (Mapping Articulated Pathways Project) and Streamlining
Pathways to Economic Mobility Through CPL, propose using AI to handle the most
time-intensive work—comparing learning outcomes. These projects enable faculty
to validate or refine the results and make decisions about credit awards. MAPP
has developed a draft framework for utilizing AI in CPL, focusing on industry
sector and region-specific pathways by using an AI routine to match industry
certificates and college courses; the process can create recommended
articulations for colleges. These results are categorized by job sector, level,
region, demand, outlook, and local college alignment, making it easy to
identify pathways from low to mid and mid to high levels such as moving from a
CNA to a phlebotomist. Similarly, the Streamlining Pathways to Economic
Mobility project will match learning outcomes by analyzing documented curricula
in military training, workforce training, and industry certifications, paving
the way to gateway jobs via a more efficient and student-centered CPL process.</p>

margin-left:.75pt'>Higher education is still in an early stage of assessment
and adoption of AI tools, services, and platforms. An April 2024 survey of 278
higher education members of EDUCAUSE community groups found that most
respondents (55%) do not currently provide access to any of the most common AI
tools or services to students, faculty or staff. Nor are most training AI tools
with institutional data (just 9%) or integrating AI products (just 6%). While
only a third of institutions provide licenses for AI tools, such as a ChatGPT,
this is still the most common type of AI resource provided. When contemplating
the cost of providing licenses to all staff, faculty, and students in the
California Community Colleges, it is worth bearing in mind that the going
retail rate for access to the premium features of ChatGPT (for example) is
twenty dollars per user, per month. To provide licenses for all active students
and employees across the California community colleges to ChatGPT Plus would
cost approximately forty million dollars per month at the retail rate. As of
May 2024, OpenAI has developed nonprofit pricing models that we are currently
exploring as an option for equitable access to premium generative AI tools and
models at scale.<sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:105%'>1</span></sup>

interest of faculty and support staff. Efforts in this domain include preparing
and supporting AI-ready students so that they learn how to use AI appropriately
to succeed in college and as members of an AI-powered workforce. One way to do
this is by sharing and promoting ASCCC guidelines on incorporating AI into the
syllabus (see Appendix B). Part of the transformation will include building
information literacy and AI learning objectives and assignments into course
objectives, syllabi, and lesson plans. We need to work together in partnership
across the system to evaluate the potential of new technologies to enhance
teaching and learning, including technologies such as: AI class assistants for
assessment and feedback; Personalized, proactive, support that complements case
management, educational planning/scheduling, and accessing financial aid; AI
that manages degree and transfer pathways, optimizing schedules based on
students’ progress through their programs of study; Accessing AI-enhanced
analytics to provide feedback and guidance on how to reach goals of increasing
learning, completion, access, and equity; Coordinating and sharing options for
discipline-specific use of AI for teaching and learning; and Making informed

faculty regarding AI was academic integrity, 62% of faculty were extremely
concerned about students using AI to cheat or violate academic integrity.  The
top concern for administrators and classified professionals was the
trustworthiness of AI models and tools with 42% and 49%, respectively,
indicating that they were extremely concerned about the trustworthiness of AI.
Trustworthiness was the second highest area of concern for faculty with 57%
indicating that they were extremely concerned about this issue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.55pt;margin-bottom:
8.0pt;margin-left:.75pt'>Listening sessions and open text responses on surveys
provided additional nuance to the concerns held about the impact of AI on the
campus workforce. Many expressed a concern that generative AI could be used to
replace faculty and other employees. The energy intensive nature of generative
AI spurred concerns that while AI may offer some environmental benefits, it
also presents significant challenges that necessitate cautious consideration.
Participants also indicated a need for clear, informed policy guidance
including consideration of how AI may change working conditions, job duties and
descriptions. There was a call for iterative review of the impacts of AI to
thoughtfully adjust implementation and use moving forward. Finally, there was a
clear need expressed for ongoing professional development around how to use AI
tools as well as ongoing discovery and evolution of practice and policy to
ensure fidelity to our values and principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.8pt;margin-bottom:8.0pt;

development needs, we further disaggregated the data from the statewide AI
survey by respondent role: faculty (n = 1,380); classified professionals (n =
791); and administrators/managers (n = 429). Of note, all three groups have
highlighted “Instruction on ethical, safe uses of AI”, “Using AI tools”, and
“Long-term impacts of AI on society” as among their top five areas of interest

challenges, the narrative surrounding AI can shift from one of apprehension to
one of optimism. Embracing AI’s potential allows for a future where technology
and humanity collaborate to create a world that is not only more efficient but
also more equitable and opportunity-rich for all. Like our private sector
counterparts, our time is now for the entire California community colleges
ecosystem to actively assess how, when and where to incorporate AI to shape the
Future of Learning; maximize educational outcomes; improve student access,
success and support; improve equity, reduce burdens for faculty, staff and
administrators; and drive operational efficiencies.</p>
