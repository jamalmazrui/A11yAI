<p><strong>•</strong> Special Chapter : What Is GPT-4?</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> What Is GPT-4?</p>
<p>GPT-4, short for <a
href="https://www.makeuseof.com/openai-launches-gpt-4-artificial-intelligence-model/">Generating
Pre-trained Transformer 4</a>, is the fourth iteration of the GPT</p>
<p>family of large language models developed by OpenAI. It is the
successor of the GPT-3</p>
<p>model, which powers the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT. GPT-4, like its
predecessor, GPT-3, is</p>
<p>designed to generate human-like text, complete tasks such as
summarization and</p>
<p>language translation, and even generate creative writing such as
poetry, lyrics for music,</p>
<p>and fiction.</p>
<p>It has been trained on a massive corpus of text data and can perform
a wide range</p>
<p>of <a
href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-natural-language-processing-and-how-does-it-work/">natural
language processing</a> tasks with impressive accuracy and fluency.</p>
<p>Before its public launch, the prospect of GPT-4 had generated a lot
of excitement in the AI</p>
<p>community due to its touted capabilities and potential applications
in various fields.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> How to Access GPT-4 on ChatGPT</p>
<p>So GPT-4 is here, but how do you join in on the action? How do you
try out all its touted</p>
<p>capabilities?</p>
<p>OpenAI has put its newest, sleekest GPT-4 model behind its $20
monthly subscription</p>
<p>plan. While this is not good news for free ChatGPT users, it is
another reason to upgrade</p>
<p>to the paid tier. If you're already on the paid plan, you can bump
your account's GPT</p>
<p>model from GPT-3.5 default and legacy to GPT-4 on demand, giving you
the option to</p>
<p>switch between both models. This should help you really appreciate
the power of the</p>
<p>GPT-4 iteration.</p>
<p>For the free tier users, to get started with GPT-4, you'll need a
ChatGPT+ subscription.</p>
<p>So, how do you upgrade to the ChatGPT+ plan?</p>
<p>How to Upgrade to ChatGPT+</p>
<p>To upgrade your ChatGPT account to the premium ChatGPT+ plan:</p>
<p>1. Head over to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> <a
href="https://chat.openai.com/">.</a></p>
<p>2. On the bottom of the left sidebar of the chat interface, locate
and click on <strong>Upgrade</strong></p>
<p>to Plus<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/index-3_1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.04167in"
alt="index-3_1.png" /></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>4. You'll get a pop-up comparing the free plan and the ChatGPT Plus
plan. Tap on the</p>
<p>green <strong>Upgrade Plan</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="media/index-3_2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.30556in"
alt="index-3_2.png" /></p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>6. Up next, you'll be redirected to a page to provide your credit
card details and other</p>
<p>billing information. Provide all the required information and make
payment.</p>
<p>7. Once your payment has been confirmed, you should now have access
to the</p>
<p>OpenAI GPT-4 model alongside the older GPT-3.5 default and GPT-3.5
legacy models.</p>
<p>8. Choose the GPT-4 model from the drop-down on your ChatGPT chat
interface, and</p>
<p>start using GPT-4 with ChatGPT.</p>
<p><img src="media/index-4_1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.44444in"
alt="index-4_1.png" /></p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>One way to be sure you're using the GPT-4 model instead of the older
models is to check</p>
<p>the color of the OpenAI logo that precedes ChatGPT's responses.
GPT-3.5 model</p>
<p>responses are preceded with a green-white logo, while GPT-4 responses
are preceded</p>
<p>with a black-white logo.</p>
<p>But what if you don't want to upgrade to ChatGPT+? Is this the end of
the road for free-</p>
<p>tier users? Not really. Here's how to use GPT-4 for free.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> How to Use GPT-4 for Free</p>
<p>While you can't currently access GPT-4 on the free version of
ChatGPT, an alternative</p>
<p>route is to use the Bing AI Chat. Yes, Bing AI is powered by OpenAI's
GPT-4 model and</p>
<p>has been for a while. So, if you've been using the new AI-powered
Bing, you've been</p>
<p>using GPT-4 without realizing it. If you're concerned about the
difference in the quality of</p>
<p>responses between GPT-4 on Bing Chat and GPT-4 on ChatGPT, don't
panic.</p>
<p>Bing Chat's GPT-4 isn't much different from ChatGPT's version. If
anything, Bing's</p>
<p>intricate tethering to the internet gives it access to much more
up-to-date and relevant</p>
<p>data and can produce more timely and relevant information as a
result. ChatGPT, on the</p>
<p>other hand, is limited by the cut-off date of its knowledge base.</p>
<p>Bing Chat aside, it's unclear whether GPT-4 will ever be available
for ChatGPT free tier</p>
<p>users. However, OpenAI is already making the GPT-4 model available to
third-party</p>
<p>developers, so sooner rather than later, you'll likely be able to
access third-party apps</p>
<p>powered by GPT-4.</p>
