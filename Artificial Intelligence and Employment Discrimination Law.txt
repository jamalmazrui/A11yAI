Defining AI in the Workplace
What is it?
What is it?
* AI is a broadly applied term that simply encompasses a computer science that studies algorithms to solve problems that usually require human intelligence.
* Machine Learning (ML) is one subset, which trains algorithms to learn and act upon data provided to it. Requires more human intervention to correct and learn.
o E.g., Spotify - Learns your music preferences and recommends new music.
* Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process in human brains. 
o Learns from a deep pool of datasets to act on its own. 
What is it?
Congressional Definition for AI
"[A] machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments."
What is it?
White House Definition:
Algorithmic Discrimination
Occurs when AI "contribute[s] to the unjustified different treatment or impacts disfavoring people based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual orientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classification protected by law."
What is it?
EEOC Definition - AI in Employment
"In the employment context, using AI has typically meant that the developer relies partly on the computer's own analysis of data to determine which criteria to use when making employment decisions. AI may include machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and understanding, intelligent decision support systems, and autonomous systems."
How is it Being Used?
* 79% Recruitment and hiring
* 41% Learning and development
* 38% Performance management
* 18% Productivity monitoring
* 8% Succession planning
* 4% Promotion decisions*
*Survey conducted of HR Professionals from February 1, 2022, to February 17, 2022
How is it Being Used?
Three-quarters of all resumes submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms.
How is it Being Used?
* Create job postings 
* Scan resumes for keywords and phrases
* Monitor employees' productivity
* Rate employee performance
* Video interviews to evaluate facial expressions & speech patterns
* Aptitude tests

How AI Can Discriminate
Primary Federal Laws
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)
Primary Federal Laws
* Title VII
* "[F]ail or refuse to hire or discharge," "deprive any individual of employment opportunities" or "adversely affect status of employment" because of: . . . 
Primary Federal Laws

* ADA
* Title I - Employment
* "No covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment."
Primary Federal Laws
* ADEA

Primary Federal Laws
* ADEA
* Unlawful for employer to:
* 3) to reduce the wage rate of any employee in order to comply with this chapter."
EEOC Technical Guidance
* Overview of ADA
* How it applies in AI context
* ERs are responsible even if administered by a vendor
* Duty to provide reasonable accommodations
* Examples of discrimination
When AI Discriminates
"Black-box AI, however, may function in a manner well outside of what the program's creators could foresee. To be sure, we may be able to tell what the AI's overarching goal was, but black-box AI may do things in ways the creators of the AI may not understand or be able to predict."

AI for People with Disabilities at Work
* 8 of 10 largest private U.S. employers use AI to track productivity metrics of individual workers 
* Millions of people interaction with screen and cameras due to disability may see unfair assessments
* Barrier to accessible accommodations, technology does not permit accommodations, difficult request process, stigmatizing request process
‌
Efforts to Curb Discrimination
What and Where?
o Global
o Federal
o State and Local
o Litigation
Global
The European Union AI Act 
Federal
White House Blueprint
Federal
* EEOC
* The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence to Assess Job Applicants and Employees
* The Americans with Disabilities Act and the Use of Software, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence
* EEOC Chair Burrows Joins DOJ, CFPB, and FTC Officials to Release Joint Statement on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automated Systems
Federal
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
Federal 
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
Federal 
President Biden's Executive Order 14110 (Nov. 1, 2023)
* Calls Federal Government-wide approach to the responsible implementation and use of AI
* Requires developers of most powerful AI systems to share their safety test results and other critical information with U.S. government
* Incorporates by reference the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Artificial Intelligence Risk Framework (AI RMF 1.0) to set standards, tools, and tests to ensure AI systems are safe before public release
* Provides clear guidance for landlords, Federal benefits programs, and federal contractors to ensure AI is not used to exacerbate discrimination
State & Local
New York City
State & Local
New York City Hiring AI Regulation
* New York City passed Local Law 144 in 2021
* First global legislation to establish and set safeguards over the use of AI and AEDTs in the workplace
* Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) are algorithmic systems
* Law requires employers to use AEDTs to audit tools for race and gender bias, publish results on electronic platforms, and notify employees and job candidates that tools are being used.
* Researchers at Cornell University found only 18 of 391 New York City employers has posted results
State & Local
Implementation of Local Law 144
* Very narrow definition of AEDTs allows for loopholes of broader use
* Compliance regulation is dependent on employee and applicant complaints - none submitted so far
* Law is intended to grow new market of auditors and compliance monitoring
* Looking forward towards more legislation - what will be effective vs. ineffective
* Push for adopting European Union Parliament (EU) AI Act, approach more focused on policy, governance, and monitoring
