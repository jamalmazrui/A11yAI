Overview 

Otter.ai is a software that transcribes speech into text, turning voice conversations into notes.   Otter creates captions for live speech, including prior recordings, and makes a written transcription of the speech.  The written transcription can be searched by key terms and shared by email or link.  Users can record a class lecture or meeting (virtual or in-person) including class discussion.  Otter can be used on your computer or mobile device.  
The user may take and select photos during the recording to be inserted in line with the transcript. After the transcript is created, the user can listen to the recording while the transcript highlights each word as it is played back.  There are options to export the text and audio transcriptions.  Otter will detect multiple speakers for you to tag in your transcript, create a space in the transcription when the speaker pauses, and uses time stamps throughout the transcription. 
The Otter Basic plan is free. You can record up to 600 minutes per month, including 3 imports, at 40 minutes per recording.  After 40 minutes, you may continue by beginning a new recording. Otter Pro is the paid version that allows you to import, record, and sync with Zoom Cloud (a paid service) up to 6000 minutes per month with 4 hours per recording.
