Overview
Accessibility Benchmarking by Industry
* TPGi has performed an automated scan of the top sites for private industry, U.S. government, and U.S. educational institutions using the Accessibility Resource Center, the ARC Platform.
* At CSUN Assistive Technology Conference 2025, we are sharing the results.
ARC Platform
* ARC provides the tools and resources to plan and execute every area of accessibility.
* ARC empowers each role at an organization to solve common issues, while growing their understanding of accessibility over time.
* Empowerment is about providing evidence of one's ability to independently achieve.
* At the platform's core is automated monitoring.
Origin Story for ARC Study
* Organizations report the state of accessibility to stakeholders as a total number of automated errors found in a website, known in ARC, as the WCAG Density Score.
* However, the number lacks a frame of reference. This invites the question:
* What is a good score?
ARC Study Objectives
* Report accessibility across an organization in relative and capitalistic terms - rather than exclusively technical terms.
* Executive stakeholders gain the ability to understand how their accessibility compares with their overall industry.
* Enable organizations to highlight accessibility as a competitive differentiator.
Data must be shifted to view it all at once
Individual data points may conflict with the big picture
Methodology
Scan Makeup
* Top ~300 websites for 14 industry sectors
o Based on SimliarWeb SEO analytics, Cloudflare Rank, and other heuristics.
o Industries are determined by the IAB Content Taxonomy.
* Top ~2,000 sites each for .gov and .edu domains
o Based on Majestic Million, SimilarWeb
Note: Individual site scores are anonymized.
Scan Technical Configuration
* Evaluates the website's homepage:
o As a first-time site visitor
o In logged-out state.
o After scripting and styling is applied.
o On page load - content that appears based on user-initiated action is not evaluated.
How ARC Reports Scan Results
Error - an element automatically identified as a WCAG violation
Alert - an element which requires further manual inspection to confirm as a WCAG violation
Best Practice - an element which may not represent a WCAG violation but impacts the user experience
What about color contrast?
Color contrast issues are not included in the WCAG Density Score
* Color contrast difficult to accurately test via automated means - overlapping elements, fixed positioning, and exempt, disabled controls all present challenges.
* A single line of CSS could result in hundreds of color contrast issues.
o Moreover, color contrast issues always require manual inspection.
o Go to the URL and run ARC Toolkit to visually inspect the automated findings.
What % of Issues Are Detected By Automated Monitoring?
* Automated testing has its limits. There's no substitute for manual testing.
* ARC's automated rules provide a level of coverage and visibility for roughly 20 of the 57 WCAG 2.2 Success Criteria.
* ARC's automated scan catch roughly 30-35% of issues.
30%? OR 57%
* There's controversy about whether color contrast issues should count in the % of automating testing coverage.
o Axe DevTools states that they detect 57% of all issues!
* The #1 automated issue is color contrast, which Axe chooses to includes in its measure.
ARC Rules compared with open-source alternatives
* ARC Rules are focused on supporting all the permutations of browser and assistive technology. 
* ARC reports issues which could impact the user experience for people who use assistive technologies, even when they do not necessarily represent a WCAG violation.
* ARC is focusing on reporting issues which could be indicative of larger WCAG violations i.e. code smells.
* ARC catches issues which may elude those newer to manual testing.
* Teams can solve common issues while growing their understanding of accessibility over time.

Most Common Automated Errors 
* The lack of a text alternative (traditional <img>, image-based links, SVG-based controls) is at the heart of nearly 50% of automated errors detected in the scan.
* WCAG Success Criteria 1.1.1 Non-text Content and 2.4.4 Link Purpose (in Context) are the most common violations.
Most Common ARC Assertions
* Assertion as in ARC asserts an element does not comply with one of ARC's accessibility rules.
o No alt text (*two similar ARC rules)
o No link text
o SVG-based control lacks an accessible name (*two similar ARC rules)
o Non-active element in the tab order
Issue: Product image-based links with product title text link
Solution: Make the product image and product title text into a single link
The image can be considered decorative as the product title text serves as the text alternative.
Fewer links equals more efficient navigation.
In-depth guide: Block Links, Cards, Clickable Regions, Rows, Etc. - Adrian Roselli
Source for the Most Common Assertions #2
* Icon-based navigation menu buttons may lack text alternatives or proper semantics.
* Hamburger menus are a gateway to navigating the site. Critical issue.
Non-active element in tab order (Alert)
* Non-active tab element in the tab order indicates that a developer recognized an element must be keyboard accessible but failed to add a semantic role.
* Indicates awareness of need for keyboard accessibility has awareness but lack of understanding of how to make the control accessible to full range of assistive technologies.
Research Highlights
Image-based links
* 50-70% of instances of a link lacking text are image-based links where the image does not have a text alternative.
* 23.6% of e-commerce site homepages have 50+ errors.
* 32 of Sports home pages have 50+ errors.
Government and Education Institutions Use Text Alternatives
* Unlike the other industries, government and education did not have no alt text or no link text as their most common issues.
* Instead, the most common issues were non-active element in tab order. Also, ARIA widget missing required parent was a top 3 finding.
Government and Education Dramatically Reduced Automated Errors
* In 12 months, top educational websites have nearly 50% fewer automated errors.
* Top government sites have nearly 30% fewer automated errors.
Carousels generate large number of errors
* ARC frequently flags carousels for having focusable elements that are hidden from the accessibility tree or having focusable elements within presentational children.
* Vehicles, Sports, and E-Commerce sites were most flagged for having these errors. 
Technical Configuration Pro-Tip!
* ARC resembles a bot. Yes, there are good bots!
* Yet bad bots cause the entire web to escalate security policies.
* More sites are using bot-blocking services which affect browser automation.
* Significant rise in .ru and .cn sites are employing these services.
* For scan resilience, it can be helpful to limit scans to specific regions.

Installation (Step 1)
Download ARC Toolkit
* Or one can search ARC Toolkit and it's comes right up!
Installation (Step 2)
* From the Chrome Web Store, select Add to Chrome
ARC Toolkit is closely tied with Developer Tools
* Once the extension is added to Chrome and enabled, open Developer Tools
o Right click the page and select Inspect OR
o Press Ctrl + Alt + I (Windows), Ctrl + Cmd + I (Mac)
ARC Toolkit is located in DevTools
* Select ARC Toolkit tab
* ARC Toolkit may be located in a dropdown at end of DevTools tabs
Run a scan whenever, wherever
* ARC Toolkit makes it easy to scan pages 
o Pages which require authentication
o Pages behind a firewall or other security policies
o Specific points deeper in user journeys
o Local file URLs
Scan Results
* Results load in the main content panel
Where to Find This Scan Data?
* This data will be released in a long-form format in TPGi's blog.
* Slides will be on CSUN conference site
* Look for out an interactive experience enabling you rank your score on a bell curve, rather than simply compare to the median alone.
I already use ARC.
* Current ARC users will get special access to the data, helping them communicate their accessibility in a new way.
* I can't wait to share what we've learned with all of you.
If interested in using the data
* Reach out to David Sloan, TPGi Chief Accessibility Officer (dsloan@tpgi.com) or me (afarber@tpgi.com).
* So much more can be done.
This scan data will be stratified by
* Technologies used in a website
* Whether a site has an accessibility statement
* Whether a site uses an accessibility overlay.
Automated testing is at the starting point of a revolution.
* TPGi is starting to make the jump from evaluating code to evaluating the visual appearance of a page.
* We've gained the ability to visually recognize buttons, headings, and other semantic elements.
* JAWS Picture Smart AI is just the start.
Perceptions Matter
* Industries which may perceive disabled people as not fully using their products have the most accessibility errors.
