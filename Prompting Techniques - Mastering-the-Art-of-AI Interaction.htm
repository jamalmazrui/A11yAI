<p>How I wrote a book in a day</p>
<p>(with a little help from Claude)</p>
<p>Claude.ai wrote this book. Or did I? I guess we did it together.</p>
<p>In July 2024, I was asked to start preparing for a Masterclass
prompting I was to give in October. While I had been developing training
and inspirational sessions on Generative AI for more than a year now, I
wanted this session to be something special. After working on the
content and the presentation for several weeks, I felt ready for the dry
run, scheduled for two weeks from now.</p>
<p>While I was working on other things, I kept coming back to the
session for fine-tuning – a never-ending story. And while I was
experimenting with the different possibilities of the tools, I thought,
“Why not try to write a companion book to the session?”</p>
<p>I was pretty happy with the content and the structure of my
presentation, so I decided to see what Copilot for Microsoft 365 could
do with it. I went to Word and asked it to create a document based on
the presentation. This works fine, but the result… was not really a
book, it was more like three pages. Very good as a summary for the
presentation, but nothing more. I asked, begged and pleaded with Copilot
(yes, we all do that sometimes) to give me more text, more pages, but it
couldn’t.</p>
<p>While Copilot for Microsoft 365 is really good for everyday tasks,
this wasn’t it. Copilot Online (the Enterprise version) gave me some
variations, as did ChatGPT and Gemini. But I realized that writing a
whole book would be quite a lot of work, more than I could handle. Next
came Claude.ai. I had experimented with Claude in the past, and I found
its results really good, but not necessarily always the best for what I
need. Copilot usually gives me really good results, including references
and online research, so that’s my go-to AI. But this time, I was in for
a treat.</p>
<p>I gave Claude the Word document that Copilot had created, and I asked
it to write me a book of 14.000 words. After a couple of seconds, I got
the following response:</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I understand that you’d like me to write an extensive book of about
15,000 words on prompt techniques, based on the Dutch document you
provided. This is a rather large task that will require careful planning
and execution. I’d be happy to help you with this project, but I think
it would be best to approach it in stages.</p>
<p>Here’s how I suggest we proceed:</p>
<p>First, let’s outline the structure of the book based on the
information in the document.</p>
<p>Then, we can work on expanding each section one at a time. We’ll
review and refine each section as we go.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll put it all together and make sure it flows well as a
complete book.</p>
<p>Does this approach sound good to you? If so, I’ll start by creating
an outline for the book. If you have any specific preferences or
additional topics you’d like to include, please let me know.</p>
<p>What followed, was one of my best experiences with Generative AI in
the past year. Claude started writing chapter after chapter, and it felt
like it knew exactly what I wanted to say. Halfway through, I had to
upgrade to a Pro account, but I was too far along to stop at that point
(Yes, I know, they got me…).</p>
<p>After about two hours, I had a pretty good draft of a book on
prompting that covered everything that’s in my Masterclass, and more! I
spent another day going through the text, rewriting paragraphs, asking
Claude to rewrite what I had written to fit in with the rest, rewriting
again, adding details, moving or removing certain parts…</p>
<p>It took me one day to write a book. One day! If I had to do it alone,
I probably wouldn’t have gotten past the introduction. I like to write
(this very chapter was written without AI), but more than 100 pages? I
have written user guides for Office apps in the past, but they usually
took more than three weeks to complete.</p>
<p>This experience shows me the true power of Generative AI: working
together, being creative and using the tool to extend that creativity.
Yes, this book was written by Claude.ai and me, and I’m proud of the
result. I hope you’ll have as much fun discovering how to improve your
prompting skills as I did writing this ebook.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>1. The Rise of Generative AI</p>
<p>In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence has witnessed a
remarkable transformation with the advent of generative AI. These
sophisticated systems, powered by advanced machine learning algorithms
and vast amounts of data, have revolutionized the way we interact with
technology and process information.</p>
<p>Generative AI, at its core, is a subset of artificial intelligence
capable of creating new content, be it text, images, music, or even
code. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to analyze and
interpret existing data, generative AI can produce original outputs that
often rival human-created content in quality and creativity.</p>
<p>The journey of generative AI began with simple text prediction models
and has now evolved into complex systems like GPT (Generative
Pre-trained Transformer) series, DALL-E, and others. These models have
shown remarkable capabilities in understanding context, generating
human-like text, creating art, and even assisting in coding tasks.</p>
<p>The impact of generative AI is being felt across various sectors:</p>
<p>1. Content Creation: Journalists, marketers, and writers are using AI
to</p>
<p>generate drafts, headlines, and even full articles.</p>
<p>2. Creative Industries: Artists and designers are experimenting with
AI-</p>
<p>generated art and designs.</p>
<p>3. Software Development: Programmers are leveraging AI to
automate</p>
<p>coding tasks and debug complex systems.</p>

<p>As generative AI continues to evolve, its potential applications seem
boundless. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the
rise of this technology has also sparked important discussions about
ethics, authenticity, and the future of human creativity.</p>
<p>2. The Importance of Effective Prompts</p>
<p>While generative AI models are incredibly powerful, their output is
only as good as the input they receive. This is where the art and
science of prompt engineering come into play. A prompt, in the context
of generative AI, is the initial input or instruction given to the AI
system to generate a response or output.</p>
<p>The importance of effective prompts cannot be overstated for several
reasons:</p>
<p>1. Quality of Output: Well-crafted prompts lead to higher quality,
more</p>
<p>relevant, and more accurate outputs from the AI system.</p>
<p>2. Efficiency: Good prompts can save time and computational resources
by</p>
<p>guiding the AI to produce desired results more quickly and with fewer
iterations.</p>
<p>3. Specificity: Effective prompts allow users to obtain highly
specific and</p>
<p>tailored responses, making the AI a more versatile tool for various
tasks.</p>
<p>4. Creativity: Thoughtful prompts can push the boundaries of AI’s
creative</p>
<p>capabilities, leading to novel and innovative outputs.</p>
<p>5. Control: By mastering prompt engineering, users gain greater
control</p>
<p>over the AI’s output, reducing unexpected or undesired results.</p>
<p>6. Problem-Solving: Complex problems can be broken down and
addressed</p>
<p>more effectively through well-structured prompts.</p>
<p>7. Ethical Considerations: Careful prompt crafting can help mitigate
biases</p>
<p>and ensure more responsible use of AI technology.</p>
<p>Understanding how to construct effective prompts is becoming an
essential skill in the age of generative AI. It bridges the gap between
human intent and machine output, allowing for more meaningful and
productive human-AI collaboration.</p>

<p>Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering</p>
<p>1. What is Prompt Engineering?</p>
<p>Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective
inputs for generative AI tools to produce desired outputs. For
information workers using tools like Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, or
Gemini, mastering prompt engineering can significantly enhance
productivity and the quality of AI-assisted work.</p>
<p>Poor prompt engineering can lead to suboptimal or even misleading
results from AI tools. Examples of bad prompts include vague requests
like “Tell me about history,” which are too broad and lack specific
focus. Overly complex or jargon-filled prompts such as “Elucidate the
multifaceted ramifications of socioeconomic disparities on educational
attainment” may confuse the AI or result in equally convoluted
responses. Biased or leading prompts like “Explain why capitalism is
always better than socialism” can produce skewed or unreliable
information.</p>
<p>Additionally, prompts that ask the AI to perform tasks beyond its
capabilities, such as “Access my personal email and summarize my recent
messages,” are ineffective and potentially raise privacy concerns.
Crafting clear, specific, and well-structured prompts is key to
leveraging AI tools effectively.</p>
<p>Key aspects of prompt engineering:</p>
<p>• It’s a skill that can be learned and improved over time</p>
<p>• It bridges the gap between human intent and AI capability</p>
<p>• It’s crucial for getting the most out of AI tools in your daily
work</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>2. The Anatomy of a Good Prompt</p>
<p>A well-crafted prompt typically consists of several key elements:</p>
<p>1. Clear Objective: What you want to achieve</p>
<p>2. Context: Relevant background information</p>
<p>3. Constraints: Any limitations or specific requirements</p>
<p>4. Format: The desired structure of the output</p>
<p>5. Examples (when helpful): Illustrations of what you’re looking
for</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a well-crafted prompt:</p>
<p>Create a brief executive summary of the Q2 sales report. Context: Our
company sells software solutions. The summary should highlight key
metrics, trends, and actionable insights. Format it as 5 bullet points,
each no longer than 2 sentences. Example of a good bullet point: ‘Q2
sales increased by 15% YoY, driven primarily by our new cloud
offering.</p>
<p>3. Key Components of Effective Prompts</p>
<p>Effective prompts are the cornerstone of successful interactions with
generative AI tools. By incorporating key components such as clarity,
specificity, context, and appropriate framing, users can guide AI models
to produce more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs across a wide
range of applications.</p>
<p>Give the AI a role</p>
<p>Assigning a role to an AI system is a powerful technique in prompt
engineering that can significantly shape the quality and relevance of
its outputs. By instructing the AI to assume a specific persona or
expertise, such as that of a scientist, historian, or creative writer,
users can effectively tailor the tone, depth, and perspective of the
AI’s responses. This approach not only helps to focus the AI’s vast
knowledge base but also encourages more contextually appropriate and
nuanced answers.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>For instance, asking an AI to respond “as a climate scientist” when
discussing environmental issues can lead to more technical and
research-oriented responses, while assigning the role of a “children’s
book author” might result in simpler, more imaginative explanations.
Role assignment thus serves as a valuable tool for users to fine-tune AI
interactions and extract more targeted and relevant information or
creative output.</p>
<p>Example<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>“Act as a marketing strategist and help me brainstorm ideas for our
new product launch.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>• Provides context for the AI’s responses</p>
<p>• Can lead to more specialized and relevant outputs</p>
<p>• Helps maintain consistency in tone and perspective</p>
<p>Setting Goals</p>
<p>Clearly articulating your objectives when interacting with AI is a
crucial aspect of effective prompt engineering. By explicitly stating
your desired outcome, you provide the AI with a clear direction and
purpose, allowing it to tailor its responses more accurately to your
needs. This practice helps eliminate ambiguity and reduces the
likelihood of irrelevant or off-topic information. Instead of vaguely
asking about a topic, specifying that you need “a brief summary suitable
for a presentation” or “a detailed analysis for a research paper” guides
the AI to structure and present information in the most useful format
for your purpose. Being specific about your goals not only improves the
quality of the AI’s output but also saves time by minimizing the need
for follow-up clarifications or revisions.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“My goal is to create a compelling presentation that convinces our
leadership to increase the IT budget.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>• Focuses the AI’s responses on your specific needs</p>
<p>• Helps avoid irrelevant or off-topic information</p>
<p>• Improves the efficiency of your interaction with the AI</p>
<p>Specifying Desired Output</p>
<p>Specifying the desired output characteristics is a key strategy in
crafting effective AI prompts. By clearly defining the type, format, and
specific attributes of the response you’re seeking, you provide the AI
with a precise framework to structure its output. This level of detail
helps ensure that the AI’s response aligns closely with your needs,
whether you’re requesting a bullet-point list, a detailed paragraph, or
a structured analysis with specific sections.</p>
<p>For instance, asking for “a 5-point action plan in markdown format”
or “a 300-word persuasive essay with three main arguments” gives the AI
clear parameters to work within. This approach not only increases the
likelihood of receiving a directly usable response but also reduces the
need for extensive editing or reformatting, ultimately saving time and
improving the overall efficiency of your AI interactions.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Generate a list of 10 potential blog post titles about workplace
productivity. Each title should be no longer than 10 words and include a
number or statistic.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>• Ensures you get the information in a usable format</p>
<p>• Saves time on reformatting or requesting changes</p>
<p>• Increases the likelihood of getting immediately applicable
results</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Providing Context</p>
<p>Providing relevant background information in your prompts helps
contextualize your request for the AI, leading to more accurate and
tailored responses. By offering pertinent details about your situation,
project, or audience, you equip the AI with crucial context that informs
its understanding and shapes its output. For example, mentioning that
you’re “preparing a presentation for high school students” or “writing a
technical report for aerospace engineers” allows the AI to adjust its
language, complexity, and focus accordingly.</p>
<p>This contextual framing helps the AI navigate its vast knowledge base
more effectively, filtering out irrelevant information and honing in on
the most appropriate content and tone for your specific needs.
Ultimately, this practice of supplying background information enhances
the relevance and usefulness of the AI’s assistance, making your
interactions more productive and aligned with your intended goals.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We’re a small B2B software company targeting HR professionals. Our
main competitor just launched a new feature that automates employee
onboarding.”</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>• Leads to more accurate and relevant responses</p>
<p>• Helps the AI understand nuances specific to your situation</p>
<p>• Can result in more insightful and tailored suggestions</p>
<p>4. Common Pitfalls in Prompt Writing</p>
<p>Common pitfalls in prompt writing can significantly hinder
AI-assisted tasks. These include being too vague or overly specific,
failing to provide necessary context, using ambiguous language or
jargon, and inadvertently introducing bias. Recognizing and avoiding
these mistakes is crucial for crafting effective prompts that yield
valuable, actionable outputs from AI tools.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Here are some useful examples:</p>
<p>1. Being Too Vague</p>
<p>Bad: “Give me some ideas for my presentation.”</p>
<p>Better: “Suggest 5 key points to include in a 10-minute presentation
on improving customer retention for a SaaS company.”</p>
<p>2. Overloading with Information</p>
<p>Bad: [A paragraph of detailed company history and current market
conditions] Better: Provide context concisely, focusing on what’s
directly relevant to your request.</p>
<p>3. Neglecting to Specify Format</p>
<p>Bad: “Write about time management techniques.” Better: “Create a
numbered list of 7 time management techniques, each with a brief
one-sentence explanation.”</p>
<p>4. Forgetting to Set Constraints</p>
<p>Bad: “Give me ideas for team-building activities.” Better: “Suggest 5
team-building activities suitable for a remote team of 20 people, each
taking no more than 30 minutes.”</p>
<p>5. Assuming AI Knows Your Specific Context</p>
<p>Bad: “What should I include in the report?” (Without providing any
context) Better: “I’m preparing a quarterly financial report for our
startup’s investors. What are the 5 most crucial elements I should
include?”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>5. Iterative Prompting</p>
<p>Prompt engineering is a dynamic and iterative process that requires
patience and creativity to master. The journey begins with crafting an
initial prompt, which serves as your first attempt to communicate your
intentions to the AI. This initial prompt is based on your understanding
of the task at hand and your expectations of what the AI can deliver.
However, it’s rare to achieve perfect results on the first try, which is
why the iterative nature of prompt engineering is so crucial.</p>
<p>Once you’ve submitted your initial prompt, the next step is to
carefully evaluate the AI’s response. This evaluation phase is critical
as it allows you to identify areas where the output aligns with your
expectations and, more importantly, where it falls short. You might find
that the AI misinterpreted certain aspects of your request, focused on
irrelevant details, or perhaps didn’t provide the depth or specificity
you were looking for. This analysis forms the foundation for the next
phase of the process.</p>
<p>Armed with insights from your evaluation, you can then refine your
prompt. This refinement might involve clarifying ambiguous terms, adding
more specific details, or restructuring the prompt to guide the AI’s
focus more effectively. The refined prompt is then submitted, and the
cycle of evaluation and refinement continues. This iterative approach
allows you to progressively hone in on exactly what you need, especially
for more complex or nuanced tasks. By patiently working through this
process, you can guide the AI to produce results that closely align with
your vision, even if it takes several iterations to get there.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of iteration:</p>
<p>1. Initial: “Give me ideas for increasing employee engagement.” 2.
Refinement: “Provide 5 specific strategies for increasing employee</p>
<p>engagement in a hybrid work environment, focusing on communication
and</p>
<p>team-building.”</p>
<p>3. Further refinement: “For each of the 5 strategies you suggested
for employee</p>
<p>engagement in a hybrid work environment, provide one real-world
example of a company successfully implementing it.”</p>
<p>By mastering these fundamentals of prompt engineering, you’ll be
well-equipped to leverage AI tools effectively in your daily work,
enhancing your productivity and the quality of your outputs across
various tasks and projects.</p>

with clients and management isn’t happy about it.”</p>
<p>Try: “Suggest 5 strategies to improve team productivity for a
software development team that’s missing project deadlines.”</p>
<p>2. Using Specific Instructions</p>
<p>Providing specific instructions helps guide the AI to produce the
exact type of output you need. This approach is crucial in prompt
engineering as it allows you to effectively steer the AI’s response
towards your desired outcome. By including detailed parameters such as
format, length, tone, perspective, and content focus in your prompts,
you create a clear framework for the AI to work within. This specificity
not only increases the likelihood of receiving relevant and tailored
responses but also reduces the need for multiple iterations. Specific
instructions act as a filter, helping the AI prioritize the most
pertinent information from its vast knowledge base. As a result, you can
more efficiently harness the AI’s capabilities, saving time and
improving the overall quality of the generated content. Whether you’re
seeking creative writing, data analysis, or problem-solving assistance,
the practice of giving specific instructions enhances the precision and
usefulness of AI-generated outputs.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• Be explicit about what you want</p>
<p>• Include numerical specifications when applicable</p>
<p>• Clarify any particular focus or angle you want the AI to take</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Instead of: “Give me some ideas for our company blog.”</p>
<p>Try: “Generate 3 blog post outlines on the topic of ‘cybersecurity
for small businesses’. Each outline should have a catchy title, 3 main
points, and a suggested call-to-action.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>3. Providing Examples</p>
<p>Including examples in your prompts can be extremely effective in
guiding the AI to produce the style and type of content you’re looking
for. Examples serve as concrete illustrations of your expectations,
providing the AI with a clear reference point for its output. By
showcasing the desired format, tone, or structure through examples, you
create a tangible model for the AI to emulate or draw inspiration from.
This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex or
nuanced requests, as it helps bridge the gap between abstract
instructions and practical implementation.</p>
<p>Examples can also help calibrate the AI’s understanding of specific
terminologies or contexts within your field of interest. Moreover, they
can demonstrate the level of detail, creativity, or technical depth you
expect in the response. By leveraging examples in your prompts, you
effectively set a benchmark for quality and relevance, increasing the
likelihood of receiving outputs that closely align with your intentions
and requirements. This strategy not only enhances the accuracy of the
AI’s responses but also streamlines the interaction process, potentially
reducing the need for multiple revisions or clarifications.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• Provide a sample of the output you want</p>
<p>• Use “in the style of” prompts for writing tasks</p>
<p>• For data analysis, show a sample insight you’d like to see</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Write a professional email to a client about a project delay. Here’s
an example of the tone and structure I’m looking for:</p>
<p>‘Dear [Client],</p>

delay in their website redesign project.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>4. Asking for Step-by-Step Responses</p>
<p>When dealing with complex tasks or processes, asking the AI to break
down its response into steps can make the information more manageable
and easier to follow. This approach transforms potentially overwhelming
information into a structured, sequential format that enhances
comprehension and retention. By requesting step-by-step explanations,
you encourage the AI to organize its knowledge in a logical progression,
ensuring that each component of the complex task is addressed in a
clear, orderly manner. This method not only aids in understanding but
also facilitates practical implementation, as users can tackle each step
individually.</p>
<p>Breaking down responses into steps is particularly valuable for
technical processes, problem-solving scenarios, or when explaining
intricate concepts to beginners. It allows for easier identification of
specific areas that might require further clarification and enables
users to pace their learning or execution of the task. Moreover, this
structured approach can reveal interdependencies between different

<p>32</p>
<p>5. Incorporating Constraints and Limitations</p>
<p>Specifying constraints helps the AI tailor its responses to your
specific needs and circumstances. By setting clear boundaries and
limitations in your prompts, you effectively narrow the AI’s focus,
ensuring that the generated content aligns more closely with your
requirements. These constraints can encompass various aspects such as
time periods, geographical locations, technological limitations, budget
considerations, or ethical guidelines. When you provide such parameters,
you’re essentially creating a customized framework within which the AI
operates, filtering out irrelevant information and concentrating on
solutions that are feasible and applicable to your situation.</p>
<p>This approach not only improves the relevance and practicality of the
AI’s responses but also saves time by reducing the need for multiple
iterations or clarifications. Constraints can also challenge the AI to
think creatively within set boundaries, potentially leading to
innovative solutions you might not have considered. Moreover, by
specifying constraints, you can ensure that the AI’s suggestions are
compatible with your resources, expertise level, or organizational
policies. This practice of defining limitations transforms generic AI
responses into tailored, actionable insights that address your unique

than 30 minutes each, and require no special equipment.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>6. Using the “Act As” Technique</p>
<p>Instructing the AI to adopt a specific role or perspective can lead
to more focused and relevant responses. This technique, often referred
to as role-prompting, leverages the AI’s ability to contextualize
information and tailor its communication style to match a particular
viewpoint or expertise.</p>
<p>By assigning a role such as “expert scientist,” “historical figure,”
or “financial advisor,” you frame the AI’s responses within a specific
knowledge domain and professional context. This approach not only helps
in obtaining more specialized and nuanced information but also ensures
that the language, tone, and level of detail align with the chosen
role’s typical communication style.</p>
<p>Role-prompting can be particularly effective when seeking diverse
perspectives on a topic, simulating professional consultations, or
exploring complex issues from multiple angles. It encourages the AI to
draw upon relevant expertise and consider factors that might be
overlooked in a more general response.</p>
<p>Additionally, this method can enhance the authenticity and depth of
the AI’s output, as it mimics the thought processes and priorities
associated with the specified role. By skillfully utilizing
role-prompting, you can transform your interactions with AI into more
dynamic, insightful, and contextually appropriate exchanges, often
yielding responses that are better suited to your specific inquiry or
scenario.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• Specify a role relevant to your task</p>
<p>• Consider roles that bring specific expertise or viewpoints</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Act as an experienced project manager. Review the following project
plan and identify potential risks and mitigation strategies:</p>
<p>[Insert your project plan here]”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>7. Combining Techniques for Complex Tasks</p>
<p>For more complex tasks, combining multiple prompt engineering
techniques can yield optimal results. This approach recognizes that
intricate problems often require multifaceted solutions. By integrating
various methods like role-prompting, specific instructions, step-by-step
breakdowns, and providing examples within constraints, you create a
synergistic effect that enhances the AI’s ability to generate
comprehensive and nuanced responses.</p>
<p>This layered approach leverages the strengths of each technique,
addressing different aspects of the task at hand. It encourages the AI
to engage from multiple angles, potentially uncovering insights that
might be missed when using a single method. Combining techniques allows
for flexibility in processing and presenting information, adapting to
the evolving nature of complex problems.</p>
<p>By skillfully blending prompting strategies, you guide the AI to
produce responses that are more accurate, relevant, creative, and
comprehensive, ultimately leading to more effective problem-solving and
decision-making in complex scenarios.</p>
<p>Example combining several techniques:</p>
<p>“Act as a marketing strategist for a B2B software company. We need to
create a content marketing plan for Q3. Please provide a step-by-step
approach to developing this plan. Include the following:</p>
<p>1. 3 main goals for the content strategy</p>
<p>2. 5 content types we should focus on (e.g., blog posts, whitepapers,
videos) 3. A content calendar template for one month</p>
<p>Constraints<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>• We have a small team of 2 content writers and 1 graphic
designer</p>
<p>• Our budget for paid promotion is $5000 for the quarter</p>
<p>• Our target audience is IT managers in mid-sized companies</p>
<p>Please format your response with clear headings and bullet points
where appropriate.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>4. Iterative Refinement</p>
<p>Prompt engineering often involves refinement through an iterative
process. If your initial prompt doesn’t yield the desired output, use
the AI’s response to inform your next attempt. Analyze the results to
identify gaps or misinterpretations, then adjust your prompt
accordingly. This might involve increasing specificity, providing better
examples, or refining constraints.</p>
<p>Each iteration helps you understand the AI’s capabilities and improve
your communication with it. By persistently refining your prompts based
on previous responses, you can significantly enhance the quality and
relevance of the AI’s output, ultimately achieving results that closely
align with your needs.</p>
<p>Example of iterative refinement:</p>
<p>1. Initial prompt: “Give me ideas for improving customer
service.”</p>
<p>2. Refined prompt: “Provide 5 specific strategies for improving
customer</p>
<p>service in an e-commerce business, focusing on reducing response
times and increasing customer satisfaction.”</p>
<p>3. Further refinement: “For each of the 5 customer service
improvement</p>
<p>strategies you suggested, provide an example of how a successful
e-commerce company has implemented it, and list one potential challenge
in implementation.”</p>
<p>By mastering these basic prompt techniques, you’ll be able to get
more out of your AI tools, leading to more productive and effective use
of these technologies in your daily work as an information worker.</p>

<p>Advanced Prompting Techniques</p>
<p>As you become more comfortable with basic prompt engineering, you can
start to leverage more advanced techniques to get even more value out of
AI tools like Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. This
chapter will explore sophisticated prompting strategies that can help
you tackle more complex tasks and achieve more nuanced results.</p>
<p>1. Prompt Priming</p>
<p>Prompt priming involves providing context or examples to the AI
before asking your main question. This technique can significantly
improve the relevance and quality of the AI’s responses.</p>
<p>Zero-Shot Prompting</p>
<p>Zero-shot prompting is a technique where an AI is asked to perform a
task without being given any specific examples or prior training for
that particular task. This approach tests the AI’s ability to generalize
its knowledge and apply it to new situations. It relies on the AI’s
broad understanding of language and concepts to interpret the request
and produce a relevant response. While challenging, successful zero-shot
prompting demonstrates the AI’s flexibility and capacity for reasoning
across diverse domains.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Classify the following email as either ‘Urgent’, ‘Important’, or
‘Routine’: [Insert email text here]”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>One-Shot Prompting</p>
<p>One-shot prompting is a technique that enhances AI task performance
by providing a single, illustrative example before requesting a similar
action. This method offers the AI a clear template to follow. By
demonstrating the desired output format or approach once, one-shot
prompting helps guide the AI’s understanding and improves the accuracy
and relevance of its responses. This technique is particularly useful
when dealing with specific formats or styles that may not be immediately
obvious from the task description alone.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Here’s an example of how to summarize a business email: Original:
‘Dear team, I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base
about the upcoming client presentation. We need to finalize the slides
by Friday, run through a practice session on Monday, and deliver the
presentation next Wednesday. Please make sure all your sections are
complete and proofread by Thursday EOD. Let me know if you have any
questions or concerns.’</p>
<p>Summary: ‘Team needs to complete presentation slides by Friday,
practice on Monday, for delivery on Wednesday. Individual sections due
Thursday EOD.’ Now, summarize the following email in a similar style:
[Insert new email text here]”</p>
<p>Few-Shot Prompting</p>
<p>Few-shot prompting is an advanced technique that leverages multiple
examples to guide an AI’s comprehension and execution of a given task.
By presenting several diverse instances of the desired input-output
relationship, this method allows the AI to discern patterns and nuances
more effectively.</p>
<p>Few-shot prompting helps the AI grasp the full scope of the task,
including potential variations and edge cases. This approach strikes a
balance between minimal guidance and extensive training, enabling the AI
to generalize from the provided examples and apply the learned concepts
to new, similar scenarios with greater accuracy and flexibility.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“I want you to classify customer feedback into categories: Positive,
Negative, or Neutral. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>‘Your product has revolutionized our workflow!’ - Positive ‘I’ve been
waiting for a response from your support team for days.’ - Negative ‘The
product works as expected.’ - Neutral</p>
<p>Now, classify the following customer feedback:</p>
<p>‘I’m not sure if this was worth the price, but it does the job.’</p>
<p>‘Absolutely terrible customer service! I’m switching to your
competitor.’</p>
<p>‘The new features in the latest update are game-changing!’</p>
<p>‘It’s okay, I guess. Nothing special.’”</p>
<p>Note that some AI tools can combine this technique with an uploaded
file. So instead of giving a short list as in the previous example, you
could refer to a file and ask the AI to do this analysis on a longer
list.</p>
<p>Mastering these prompt priming techniques—zero-shot, one-shot, and
few-shot prompting—can significantly enhance your interactions with AI
systems. Each method has its strengths and is suitable for different
scenarios, depending on the complexity of the task and the level of
guidance required.</p>
<p>As you practice and experiment with these methods, you’ll develop a
intuitive sense of which approach works best for various tasks, allowing
you to leverage AI capabilities more effectively in your personal and
professional endeavors.</p>
<p>2. Chain of Thought Prompting</p>
<p>Chain-of-thought prompting is a powerful technique that encourages AI
systems to articulate their reasoning process step-by-step. By prompting
the AI to show its work, this method provides insight into the logical
pathways the system follows to reach its conclusions. This approach is
particularly valuable for complex problem-solving or decision-making
tasks, as it allows users to understand and verify the AI’s thought
process. Chain-of-thought prompting not only improves the transparency
of AI responses but also often leads to more accurate results, as the
systematic breakdown of reasoning can help the AI catch potential errors
or oversights in its own logic.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“As a financial analyst, evaluate whether our company should invest
in expanding our e-commerce platform or opening a new physical store
location. Walk me through your thought process step-by-step, considering
factors such as initial costs, potential ROI, market trends, and
long-term scalability.”</p>
<p>3. XML Tagging in Prompts</p>
<p>Using XML-like tags ( or [your text] for example) in your prompts can
help structure the AI’s response and make it easier to parse specific
information. This technique allows you to clearly define sections and
expectations for the AI’s output, resulting in more organized and
targeted responses. By incorporating tags, you can guide the AI to
provide information in a specific format or structure, making it simpler
to extract and utilize the data you need.</p>
<p>This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex
queries that require multiple components or when you want to ensure
consistency across multiple AI-generated responses. Additionally,
XML-like tags can help improve the clarity of your prompts, reducing the
likelihood of misinterpretation by the AI and leading to more accurate
and relevant outputs.</p>
<p>Within a longer conversation with an AI, using tags can be especially
beneficial as they provide clear reference points. This makes it easier
for the AI to understand which specific parts of previous exchanges
you’re referring to, enhancing the coherence and continuity of the
dialogue. By consistently using tags throughout a conversation, you
create a shared framework that both you and the AI can rely on to
maintain context and focus.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Analyze our company’s Q2 performance and provide the following:
&lt;summary&gt;</p>
<p>A brief overview of the overall performance</p>
<p>&lt;/summary&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;key_metrics&gt;</p>
<p>List the top 3 KPIs and their values</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>&lt;/key_metrics&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;areas_for_improvement&gt;</p>
<p>Identify 2 areas where we underperformed and suggest improvement
strategies &lt;/areas_for_improvement&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;outlook&gt;</p>
<p>Provide a brief forecast for Q3 based on Q2 results
&lt;/outlook&gt;”</p>
<p>4. Self-Criticism and Iterative Refinement</p>
<p>Encouraging the AI to evaluate and improve its own responses can
significantly enhance the quality of its outputs. This self-reflective
approach prompts the AI to critically analyze its initial answers,
considering factors such as accuracy, relevance, and completeness. By
incorporating this step, users can obtain more refined and precise
information. The process may involve asking the AI to double-check its
facts, consider alternative perspectives, or elaborate on certain
points. This iterative improvement cycle not only leads to more accurate
responses but also helps in uncovering nuances or details that might
have been overlooked initially. Moreover, it mimics human cognitive
processes of review and refinement, potentially resulting in more
thoughtful and comprehensive answers. Ultimately, this practice can
transform the AI from a simple query-response tool into a more dynamic
and adaptive assistant capable of producing higher-quality, more
reliable outputs.</p>
<p>Example<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>“Generate a marketing email for our new productivity app. After
generating the email, critically evaluate it for persuasiveness,
clarity, and adherence to best practices in email marketing. Then, based
on your evaluation, rewrite the email to address any shortcomings you
identified.”</p>
<p>5. Reverse Engineering Prompts</p>
<p>The technique of asking an AI to generate a prompt that would produce
a specific type of output is a powerful method for enhancing prompt
engineering skills.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>This approach, often referred to as “reverse prompting” or “prompt
generation,” involves tasking the AI with creating the input that would
lead to a desired output. By engaging in this exercise, users can gain
valuable insights into the structure and components of effective prompts
for particular tasks.</p>
<p>This method can reveal nuances in language, formatting, and context
that might not be immediately apparent when crafting prompts from
scratch. It’s particularly useful for complex or specialized tasks where
the ideal prompt structure may not be intuitive. Additionally, this
technique can help users understand the AI’s “thought process” and how
it interprets different prompt elements. As users compare the
AI-generated prompts with their own, they can refine their prompt
crafting skills, leading to more precise and efficient interactions with
AI systems across various applications.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Here’s a well-written project status update:</p>
<p>[Insert a sample project status update]</p>
<p>What prompt would you give to an AI assistant to generate a similar
project status update? Please provide the prompt and explain why each
element of the prompt is important.”</p>
<p>6. Multi-Turn Conversation Design (prompt chaining)</p>
<p>Designing a series of prompts that build on each other is an
effective strategy for tackling complex tasks or generating more
comprehensive outputs with AI. This approach, also known as “chain
prompting” or “prompt chaining,” involves breaking down a complex task
into smaller, manageable steps, each addressed by a separate prompt. By
structuring prompts in this sequential manner, users can guide the AI
through a logical progression of thought, simulating a multi-turn
conversation.</p>
<p>This method is particularly useful for tasks that require in-depth
analysis, creative problem-solving, or the synthesis of multiple
concepts. For instance, when creating a comprehensive business plan, you
might start with prompts that gather essential information about the
business idea, target market, and initial resources. Then, subsequent
prompts can focus on developing specific sections of the business plan,
such as market analysis, financial projections, and</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>marketing strategies.</p>
<p>This step-by-step approach allows for more nuanced exploration of
each aspect of the plan, ensuring that all crucial elements are
thoroughly addressed. Moreover, it enables users to review and refine
intermediate outputs, ensuring the final result is comprehensive and
well-aligned with the overall objective. By employing this technique,
users can leverage AI to produce more sophisticated, well-reasoned, and
thorough outputs for complex scenarios, while maintaining control over
the direction and content of the conversation.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>“We’re going to create a comprehensive business plan for a new
startup. We’ll do this in stages. First, ask me a series of questions to
gather the necessary information about the business idea, target market,
and initial resources. Then, we’ll go through each section of the
business plan one by one, with you providing guidance and generating
content based on my responses.”</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>1. “Generate a list of 5 potential topics for our company blog,
focusing on</p>
<p>emerging trends in our industry.”</p>
<p>2. “For each of the blog topics you just generated, create a brief
outline with</p>
<p>main points.”</p>
<p>3. “Take the first outline and expand it into a full blog post of
approximately 800</p>
<p>words.”</p>
<p>4. “Now, generate 5 engaging social media posts to promote this blog
post on</p>
<p>different platforms.”</p>
<p>5. Prompt Templates for Recurring Tasks</p>
<p>Developing reusable prompt templates for tasks you perform regularly
is a strategic approach to streamline your AI interactions and enhance
productivity. By creating a library of well-crafted, task-specific
prompts, you can save significant time and effort in your day-to-day
work with AI systems. These templates serve as standardized frameworks
that can be easily adapted or customized for specific instances,
ensuring consistency in your outputs and</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>reducing the likelihood of overlooking important details or
instructions.</p>
<p>For example, if you frequently use AI for market analysis, you might
create a template that outlines key areas to explore, such as competitor
landscape, customer demographics, and emerging trends.</p>
<p>To maximize the benefits of this approach, consider using readily
available tools like Notepad, OneNote, or specialized prompt management
applications to organize and store your prompt templates. These tools
allow for easy reference, quick retrieval, and ongoing refinement of
your prompts. By categorizing your templates based on task types or
departments, you can create a comprehensive prompt library that is
accessible and user-friendly. Sharing these templates within your team
or organization can promote best practices and maintain uniformity in AI
interactions across different users. Remember to regularly review and
update your prompt templates to ensure they remain effective and aligned
with your evolving objectives.</p>
<p>Example template for weekly report generation:</p>
<p>“Generate a weekly report for the [DEPARTMENT] department covering
the period from [START_DATE] to [END_DATE]. Include the following
sections: 1. Executive Summary</p>
<p>2. Key Performance Indicators</p>
<p>a. [KPI_1]</p>
<p>b. [KPI_2]</p>
<p>c. [KPI_3]</p>
<p>3. Major Achievements</p>
<p>4. Challenges Faced</p>
<p>5. Upcoming Week’s Priorities</p>
<p>6. Resources Needed</p>
<p>For each section, provide concise bullet points. The entire report
should not exceed one page when formatted. “</p>
<p>7. Combining Multiple AI Tools</p>
<p>By strategically combining various AI tools, you can tackle complex
tasks more effectively and efficiently. Each AI system has its own
unique strengths and</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>capabilities, whether it’s natural language processing, image
recognition, data analysis, or predictive modeling. Learning to identify
the ideal tool for each component of a multifaceted problem allows you
to create powerful workflows.</p>
<p>For instance, you might use one tool for initial brainstorming, a
specialized analytics tool to crunch numbers, and a visualization AI to
present findings. This synergistic approach not only enhances
problem-solving but also often leads to more innovative and
comprehensive solutions than relying on a single AI system alone.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>1. Use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and create an outline for a
presentation. 2. Use Microsoft Copilot to generate the actual slides
based on the outline. 3. Use DALL-E or Midjourney to create custom
images for key slides. 4. Use Claude to review and refine the final
presentation content.</p>
<p>By mastering these advanced prompting techniques, you’ll be able to
tackle more complex tasks, generate higher-quality outputs, and use AI
tools more efficiently in your work as an information professional.
Remember, the key to success with these techniques is practice and
experimentation. Don’t be afraid to try different approaches and refine
your prompts based on the results you get.</p>

<p>Specialized Prompt Techniques for</p>
<p>Different Domains</p>
<p>Within your work environment, you likely engage with various types of
tasks across different domains. This chapter will explore how to tailor
your prompting techniques to specific areas of work, helping you
leverage AI tools more effectively for each type of task.</p>
<p>1. Writing and Content Creation</p>
<p>AI tools can be powerful allies in various writing tasks, from emails
to reports to marketing copy. Here are some specialized techniques for
writing-related prompts.</p>
<p>Style Emulation</p>
<p>Style emulation is a powerful technique that allows you to harness
AI’s language capabilities to mimic specific writing styles. This
approach is particularly useful when you need to maintain consistency
across different pieces of content or when you want to adapt your
writing to a particular brand voice. By providing clear instructions
about the desired style, or even offering a sample text as a reference,
you can guide the AI to produce content that aligns with your intended
tone, vocabulary, and sentence structure. This can be especially
valuable for marketing materials, where brand consistency is crucial, or
for creative writing exercises where you want to experiment with
different authorial voices.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Write an internal memo (about 150 words) announcing a new data
management policy in the style of our CEO, Sarah Johnson. Her
communication style is known for being clear, forward-thinking, and
mildly optimistic. Use short paragraphs, incorporate one or two relevant
statistics, and end with a call to action. Focus on how</p>
<p>this policy will improve efficiency and data security.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Audience-Focused Writing</p>
<p>Tailoring content to a specific audience is a crucial aspect of
effective communication. By specifying the target audience in your
prompts, you can guide the AI to create content that resonates with the
intended readers. This involves considering factors such as the
audience’s background knowledge, interests, reading level, and
preferences.</p>
<p>Audience-focused writing ensures that the language, examples, and
level of detail in the content are appropriate and engaging for the
specific group you’re addressing. This technique can significantly
enhance the impact and effectiveness of your communications, whether
you’re creating educational materials, marketing content, or technical
documentation.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Create an explanation of our company’s new cloud security measures.
The target audience is non-technical C-level executives. Use analogies
to explain complex concepts and focus on business benefits.”</p>
<p>Tone Adjustment</p>
<p>Tone adjustment is a nuanced aspect of writing that can greatly
influence how your message is received. By explicitly directing the AI
to use a specific tone, you can ensure that the emotional context of
your content aligns with your communication goals.</p>
<p>This technique is particularly useful when you need to convey
sensitive information, manage customer relations, or adapt your message
for different contexts. Whether you need to strike a formal, casual,
empathetic, or authoritative tone, providing clear instructions to the
AI can help you achieve the desired emotional resonance in your
writing.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Rewrite the following customer service email in a more empathetic
and solution-oriented tone:</p>
<p>[Insert original email]”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Structured Writing Prompts</p>
<p>Using structured writing prompts is an effective way to guide the AI
in creating well-organized, coherent content. By outlining the desired
structure of the content in your prompt, you provide a clear framework
for the AI to follow. This approach is particularly useful for
longer-form content like articles, reports, or presentations, where a
logical flow of information is crucial.</p>
<p>Structured prompts can help ensure that all necessary points are
covered, that the content progresses in a logical manner, and that the
overall piece achieves its intended purpose. This technique can save you
time in editing and reorganizing content, as the initial output is
already well-structured.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Write a blog post about the benefits of remote work. Structure it as
follows: 1. Introduction (2 paragraphs)</p>
<p>2. 3 main benefits (1 paragraph each)</p>
<p>3. Potential challenges (1 paragraph)</p>
<p>4. How to overcome challenges (2 paragraphs)</p>
<p>5. Conclusion (1 paragraph)”</p>
<p>Data Analysis and Visualization</p>
<p>While AI tools may not directly create visualizations, they can
sometimes assist in interpreting data and suggesting visualization
approaches.</p>
<p>Data Interpretation Prompts</p>
<p>Data interpretation prompts leverage AI’s analytical capabilities to
extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. By framing your
requests in terms of deriving insights and suggesting visualizations,
you can tap into the AI’s ability to identify patterns, trends, and
correlations that might not be immediately apparent.</p>
<p>This approach can be particularly valuable when dealing with large or
multifaceted datasets, where manual analysis might be time-consuming or
prone to overlooking subtle relationships. By using these prompts, you
can quickly</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>generate hypotheses, identify areas for further investigation, and
get suggestions for effective ways to communicate your findings
visually.</p>
<p>Please note that not every AI tool is equally capable of uploading
and analyzing files, although this is one of the domains where
Generative AI tools are rapidly evolving.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“I have sales data for our products over the last 12 months. The
columns are: Date, Product Name, Units Sold, Revenue. What are the top 3
insights you can derive from this data? For each insight, suggest an
appropriate type of data visualization to represent it.”</p>
<p>Visualization Recommendation</p>
<p>Choosing the right type of visualization is crucial for effectively
communicating data-driven insights. By asking the AI for visualization
recommendations, you can benefit from its knowledge of various chart
types and their appropriate uses. This technique involves providing the
AI with information about your data and your communication goals,
allowing it to suggest the most effective visual representation.</p>
<p>This can be particularly helpful when dealing with complex
relationships between variables or when you’re unsure of the best way to
present your data. The AI can provide rationales for its suggestions,
helping you understand the pros and cons of different visualization
approaches.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“I need to present data showing the relationship between employee
satisfaction scores and productivity levels across different
departments. What type of chart or graph would best represent this data,
and why?”</p>
<p>Metric Selection</p>
<p>Identifying the most relevant metrics for a given scenario is a
critical step in data analysis and performance measurement. By engaging
the AI in metric</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>selection, you can leverage its broad knowledge of key performance
indicators (KPIs) across various domains. This technique involves
describing your specific situation or goals and asking the AI to
recommend the most appropriate metrics to track.</p>
<p>The AI can not only suggest relevant KPIs but also explain their
significance and how they should be calculated. This approach can help
ensure that you’re focusing on the most meaningful data points for your
particular context, leading to more insightful analysis and more
effective decision-making.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We’re launching a new e-commerce website. What are the top 5 KPIs we
should track to measure its success in the first 3 months? For each KPI,
explain why it’s important and how it should be calculated.”</p>
<p>Problem-Solving and Strategic Planning</p>
<p>AI can be a valuable brainstorming partner and can help structure
your approach to complex problem.</p>
<p>Structured Problem-Solving Frameworks</p>
<p>Applying structured problem-solving frameworks to complex situations
can provide valuable insights and organization to your thinking process.
By asking the AI to use specific frameworks like SWOT analysis, PESTLE
analysis, or the 5 Whys, you can ensure a comprehensive and methodical
approach to problem-solving.</p>
<p>This technique leverages the AI’s ability to systematically consider
multiple aspects of a situation, helping you identify key factors,
potential issues, and opportunities that might otherwise be overlooked.
Using structured frameworks can also facilitate clearer communication of
your analysis to stakeholders and provide a solid foundation for
strategic decision-making.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Use the SWOT analysis framework to evaluate our plan to expand into
the Asian market. Provide at least 3 points for each category
(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).”</p>
<p>Scenario Planning</p>
<p>Scenario planning is a powerful strategic tool that involves
exploring multiple potential future outcomes. By engaging AI in scenario
planning exercises, you can quickly generate and analyze various
‘what-if’ scenarios.</p>
<p>This technique involves describing different possible situations or
strategies and asking the AI to explore their implications, benefits,
and risks. By doing so, you can gain a broader perspective on potential
outcomes, identify key variables that might influence your success, and
develop more robust and flexible strategies. This approach is
particularly valuable in rapidly changing or uncertain environments,
helping you prepare for multiple contingencies.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We’re considering three different pricing strategies for our new
SaaS product. For each of the following strategies, outline the
potential benefits and risks: 1. Freemium model</p>
<p>2. Tiered pricing based on features</p>
<p>3. Usage-based pricing</p>
<p>After analyzing each, recommend which strategy you think is best and
why.”</p>
<p>Decision Matrix Creation</p>
<p>Creating decision matrices is an effective way to objectively
evaluate options across multiple criteria. By utilizing AI to help
create and populate these matrices, you can benefit from its ability to
systematically consider and weigh various factors.</p>
<p>This technique involves specifying your decision criteria and
potential options, then asking the AI to structure this information into
a matrix format. The AI can suggest scoring systems, help you think
through the relative importance of different criteria, and guide you in
using the matrix to reach a decision.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>This approach can be particularly useful for complex decisions with
multiple stakeholders or where numerous factors need to be balanced.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We need to choose a new office location. The criteria we’re
considering are: cost, accessibility for employees, proximity to
clients, and potential for growth. Create a decision matrix comparing
our three potential locations (City Center, Suburb A, and Business Park
B) across these criteria. Suggest a scoring system and walk me through
how to use this matrix to make a decision.”</p>
<p>Project Management</p>
<p>AI tools can assist in various aspects of project management, from
planning to risk assessment.</p>
<p>Task Breakdown:</p>
<p>Breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks is a fundamental
skill in project management. By leveraging AI for task breakdown, you
can quickly generate comprehensive lists of tasks and subtasks for your
projects. This technique involves describing your project goals and
major phases, then asking the AI to provide a detailed breakdown of
specific tasks. The AI can help ensure that no crucial steps are
overlooked, suggest logical sequences for tasks, and even provide
estimated timeframes. This approach can significantly speed up the
project planning process and help you create more thorough and realistic
project schedules.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We’re planning to migrate our CRM system to a new platform. Break
this project down into major phases, and then list at least 5 specific
tasks for each phase. Include estimated time frames for each task.”</p>
<p>Risk Identification and Mitigation</p>
<p>Identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies is
crucial for</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>project success. By using AI to brainstorm risks and mitigation
approaches, you can tap into a broad knowledge base of potential issues
across various project types.</p>
<p>This technique involves describing your project and asking the AI to
identify possible risks, ranging from technical challenges to resource
constraints to external factors. For each identified risk, the AI can
suggest potential mitigation strategies, helping you develop a
comprehensive risk management plan. This approach can help you
anticipate and prepare for a wider range of potential issues, increasing
the likelihood of project success.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We’re launching a new mobile app in 3 months. Identify 10 potential
risks we might face during the development and launch process. For each
risk, suggest a mitigation strategy.”</p>
<p>Resource Allocation</p>
<p>Effective resource allocation is key to optimizing project efficiency
and success. By engaging AI in resource allocation planning, you can
quickly generate and evaluate different allocation scenarios.</p>
<p>This technique involves providing information about your available
resources and project requirements, then asking the AI to suggest
allocation strategies. The AI can help you think through the
implications of different allocation approaches, identify potential
bottlenecks, and suggest ways to optimize resource usage across
different project phases. This can lead to more efficient project
execution and help you make the most of your available resources.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We have a team of 5 developers, 2 designers, and 1 project manager
for our upcoming website redesign project. The project needs to be
completed in 12 weeks. Suggest how we should allocate these resources
across the different phases of the project (Planning, Design,
Development, Testing, Launch). Provide a rough timeline and explain your
reasoning.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Customer Service and Communication</p>
<p>AI can help in crafting effective customer communications and
developing service strategies.</p>
<p>Response Templates</p>
<p>Creating effective response templates for common customer service
scenarios can significantly improve efficiency and consistency in
customer communications. By using AI to generate these templates, you
can quickly produce a variety of well-crafted responses for different
situations.</p>
<p>This technique involves describing specific customer service
scenarios and asking the AI to create appropriate response templates.
The AI can help ensure that the templates strike the right tone, include
all necessary information, and adhere to best practices in customer
service communication. This approach can save time for your customer
service team and help maintain high-quality, consistent responses across
various channels and situations.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“Create 3 email templates for the following customer service
scenarios: 1. Responding to a complaint about a delayed shipment 2.
Helping a customer reset their password</p>
<p>3. Thanking a customer for positive feedback</p>
<p>Each template should be friendly, empathetic, and solution
oriented.”</p>
<p>Complaint Analysis</p>
<p>Analyzing patterns in customer complaints is crucial for identifying
systemic issues and improving overall service quality. By leveraging AI
for complaint analysis, you can quickly process large volumes of
customer feedback and extract meaningful insights.</p>
<p>This technique involves providing the AI with a set of customer
complaints and asking it to identify common themes, underlying issues,
and potential areas for improvement. The AI can help you spot trends
that might not be immediately apparent, prioritize issues based on their
frequency or severity, and suggest concrete actions to address the root
causes of common complaints. This approach can lead to more data-driven
decision-making in your customer service strategy.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“I have a list of the top 20 customer complaints we received last
month. Analyze these complaints, identify any common themes or issues,
and suggest 3 concrete actions we could take to address the most
prevalent problems.”</p>
<p>Communication Strategy Development</p>
<p>Developing effective communication strategies for specific scenarios
is essential for maintaining strong customer relationships and managing
expectations. By engaging AI in communication strategy development, you
can quickly generate comprehensive plans for various situations.</p>
<p>This technique involves describing a specific communication need and
asking the AI to develop a strategy that covers aspects such as timing,
channels, key messages, and potential customer reactions. The AI can
help you consider multiple angles of the communication challenge, ensure
that your strategy is comprehensive, and anticipate potential customer
concerns or questions. This approach can lead to more thorough and
effective communication planning, helping you navigate complex or
sensitive situations with greater confidence.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>“We need to inform our customers about an upcoming planned service
outage for system maintenance. Develop a communication strategy that
includes:</p>
<p>1. Timing of notifications (how far in advance, how often) 2.
Channels to use (email, app notifications, social media, etc.) 3. Key
messages to include in each communication 4. How to handle customer
concerns or questions about the outage”</p>
<p>By tailoring your prompts to these specific domains, you can more
effectively leverage AI tools to assist you in various aspects of your
work as an information professional. Remember, the key to success is to
be specific in your prompts, provide relevant context, and iterate based
on the responses you receive.</p>

sold)</p>
<p>4. Underperforming Products (bottom 3 products, with potential
reasons for</p>
<p>underperformance)</p>
<p>5. Regional Analysis (breakdown of sales by region, highlighting
any</p>
<p>significant differences)</p>
<p>6. Recommendations for Next Quarter (3-5 actionable suggestions based
on</p>
<p>the data)</p>
<p>For each section, suggest what type of chart or graph would best
represent the data. Keep the language clear and suitable for a
non-technical audience.”</p>
<p>Project Status Report</p>
<p>“Generate a project status report for our website redesign project.
The report should include:</p>
<p>1. Project Overview (2-3 sentences)</p>

<p>3. Current Status (on track, behind schedule, or ahead of schedule -
choose</p>
<p>based on the accomplishments)</p>
<p>4. Upcoming Milestones (next 3-4 major tasks with deadlines)</p>
<p>5. Risks and Issues (any potential problems or current issues, with
proposed</p>
<p>solutions)</p>
<p>6. Resource Allocation (brief overview of how team members are
being</p>
<p>utilized)</p>
<p>7. Budget Status (whether we’re within budget, over, or under - you
can</p>
<p>decide this)</p>
<p>Format the report in a way that’s easy to skim, using bullet points
where appropriate. The tone should be professional and objective.”</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>3. Presentation Creation</p>
<p>AI can be a valuable tool in assisting in the creation of engaging
presentations. Here’s how to use it effectively:</p>
<p>Presentation Outline</p>
<p>“I need to create a 15-minute presentation on ‘The Future of Remote
Work’ for our annual company meeting. Please provide an outline for this
presentation, including:</p>
<p>1. An attention-grabbing introduction</p>
<p>2. 3-4 main points to cover (with brief descriptions)</p>
<p>3. Supporting data or examples for each point (you can suggest
hypothetical</p>
<p>statistics or case studies)</p>
<p>4. A compelling conclusion</p>
<p>5. 2-3 thought-provoking questions for a Q&amp;A session</p>
<p>For each section, suggest a type of visual aid (chart, image,
infographic) that could enhance the point being made. The tone should be

<p>1. First, list 5-7 potential reasons for high customer churn in SaaS
products.</p>
<p>2. For each reason, suggest a method to investigate whether this is a
factor</p>
<p>in our situation.</p>
<p>3. Now, propose 3 possible solutions to address customer churn,
assuming</p>
<p>we’ve identified the top reasons.</p>
<p>4. For each solution, outline:</p>
<p>a. The potential benefits</p>
<p>b. Possible drawbacks or risks</p>
<p>c. Resources needed to implement</p>
<p>5. Finally, recommend which solution you think we should pursue first
and</p>
<p>why.</p>
<p>Present this analysis in a structured format, suitable for sharing
with the management team.”</p>
<p>By tailoring your prompts to these specific use cases, you can
leverage AI tools more effectively in your daily work. Remember to be
specific in your requests, provide necessary context, and don’t hesitate
to ask for clarification or iterations if the initial output doesn’t
fully meet your needs.</p>

<p>Ethical Considerations in Prompt</p>
<p>Engineering</p>
<p>As AI tools become increasingly integrated into our work processes,
it’s crucial to consider the ethical implications of their use. This
chapter will explore key ethical considerations in prompt engineering
and provide guidelines for responsible use of AI in the workplace.</p>
<p>1. Avoiding Bias and Discrimination</p>
<p>AI models, despite their impressive capabilities, are not immune to
biases. These systems can unknowingly perpetuate or even amplify
prejudices and stereotypes present in their training data. This
phenomenon occurs because machine learning algorithms learn patterns
from historical data, which may contain societal biases accumulated over
time.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to approach AI-generated content with a critical eye and
an understanding of these limitations. You should be aware that AI
outputs may reflect and potentially exacerbate existing societal biases
related to race, gender, age, or other sensitive attributes.</p>
<p>Additionally, human oversight and intervention play vital roles in
mitigating AI bias. By combining AI capabilities with human judgment and
ethics, we can work towards more equitable and unbiased outcomes. This
approach involves questioning AI-generated results, cross-referencing
information from multiple sources, and consistently considering the
broader societal impact of AI applications.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Guidelines<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>1. Be mindful of potential biases in your prompts</p>
<p>Example of a biased prompt: “Generate a description of a typical
successful entrepreneur.”</p>
<p>Improved prompt: “Generate diverse examples of successful
entrepreneurs, including people of various genders, ethnicities, and
backgrounds.”</p>
<p>2. Review and critically evaluate AI-generated content</p>
<p>Always review AI outputs for potential biases or stereotypes before
using them in your work.</p>
<p>3. Use inclusive language in your prompts</p>
<p>Example: Instead of “businessman” or “businesswoman”, use “business
professional” or “entrepreneur”.</p>
<p>4. When dealing with sensitive topics, explicitly instruct the AI to
be neutral</p>
<p>and factual</p>
<p>Example: “Provide an objective summary of the current debate on
[sensitive topic]. Present multiple viewpoints without favoring any
particular stance.”</p>
<p>2. Ensuring Privacy and Data Protection</p>
<p>When using AI tools, it’s crucial to protect sensitive information
and respect privacy boundaries. You must be vigilant about the data you
input into these systems, as they may store or process information in
ways you don’t fully control. Be cautious about sharing personal
identifiers, confidential business information, or any data that could
compromise individual privacy or organizational security.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand the privacy policies and data handling
practices of the AI tools you use. Some systems may retain inputted data
for model improvement, which could potentially expose sensitive
information. Always use these tools in compliance with relevant data
protection regulations and your organization’s privacy guidelines.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>Consider anonymizing or generalizing information when possible before
inputting it into AI systems. This approach can help maintain privacy
while still allowing you to leverage AI capabilities. Additionally, be
mindful of the context in which you’re using AI tools – certain
environments may require extra precautions or may not be suitable for AI
assistance at all.</p>
<p>Remember that AI models can sometimes generate detailed outputs based

it to ensure no unintended disclosures occur. By maintaining a strong
focus on privacy and data protection, you can harness the benefits of AI
while safeguarding sensitive information.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>1. Avoid inputting personally identifiable information (PII) into AI
tool</p>
<p>Instead of using real names or specific details, use placeholders or
anonymized data.</p>
<p>2. Be cautious with confidential business information</p>
<p>Example of what to avoid: “Analyze our confidential sales data for
Q2, which I’ll paste here: [confidential data]”</p>
<p>Better approach: “I need to analyze some sales data. Can you provide
a general framework for analyzing quarterly sales trends without me
sharing the actual data?”</p>
<p>3. Understand the data retention policies of the AI tools you’re
using</p>
<p>Some AI services may retain input data for model improvement. Be
aware of this when deciding what information to input.</p>
<p>4. When generating content about individuals, respect their

assistance from AI language models. All content has been reviewed and
verified by [Your Name].”</p>
<p>2. Distinguish between AI-generated content and human-created
content</p>
<p>When collaborating on documents, you might use comments or
highlighting to indicate which parts were AI-assisted.</p>
<p>3. Be prepared to explain your use of AI tools</p>
<p>Understand how the AI arrives at its outputs so you can explain the
process if asked.</p>
<p>4. Don’t misrepresent AI capabilities</p>
<p>Avoid implying that AI can provide authoritative answers on subjects
requiring human expertise or judgment.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>4. Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability</p>
<p>While AI tools can be incredibly helpful, they can also make mistakes
or generate inaccurate information. These systems, despite their
sophistication, are not infallible. They can produce errors,
inconsistencies, or even completely fabricated information - a
phenomenon often referred to as “hallucination” in AI contexts. This is
particularly common when the AI is asked to operate outside its training
domain or when dealing with ambiguous queries.</p>
<p>You should always approach AI-generated content with a critical
mindset. Fact-check important information, especially when it relates to
critical decisions or sensitive topics. Be particularly wary of AI
responses that seem too confident or precise, as this can sometimes mask
underlying uncertainties or inaccuracies. It’s also important to
remember that AI models have knowledge cutoffs and may not be up-to-date
with the most recent information. They can sometimes present outdated
facts or fail to account for recent developments in rapidly evolving
fields.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, consider using AI-generated content as a
starting point rather than a definitive answer. Cross-reference
information with reputable sources, and when in doubt, seek human expert
opinion. By maintaining a balanced approach - leveraging AI’s strengths
while being aware of its limitations - you can maximize the benefits of
these tools while minimizing potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Guidelines<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>1. Always fact-check important information</p>
<p>Example prompt: “I’m going to use the information you provide in a
client presentation. Please only include facts you’re very confident
about, and indicate any areas where you’re less certain.”</p>
<p>2. Use AI as a starting point, not the final word</p>
<p>Treat AI outputs as drafts or suggestions that require human review
and verification.</p>
<p>3. Be aware of the AI’s knowledge cutoff date</p>
<p>For topics that may have recent developments, include a prompt like:
“Please note that your knowledge might not be up to date. I’ll verify
any recent information myself.”</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>4. Cross-reference AI-generated information with reliable sources</p>
<p>Don’t rely solely on AI for critical business decisions or sensitive
information.</p>
<p>5. Responsible Use of AI-Generated Content</p>
<p>As artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize various aspects
of our work and daily lives, it is crucial to approach the use of
AI-generated content with thoughtfulness and responsibility. The ethical
deployment of AI tools requires careful consideration of their broader
implications, including their impact on intellectual property,
employment landscapes, personal skill development, and environmental
sustainability.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>1. Respect intellectual property rights</p>
<p>Don’t use AI to reproduce copyrighted content without permission. Be
cautious when asking AI to generate content similar to existing
works.</p>
<p>2. Consider the impact on jobs and skills</p>
<p>Use AI to enhance your work, not to replace critical thinking or
creativity. Focus on using AI for tasks that free up time for
higher-value activities</p>
<p>3. Maintain your own expertise</p>
<p>Don’t become overly reliant on AI. Continue to develop your own
skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>4. Be mindful of the environmental impact</p>
<p>Large language models require significant computational resources.
Use AI tools judiciously and efficiently.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>6. Ethical Prompt Engineering in Practice</p>

<p>Measuring and Improving Prompt</p>
<p>Effectiveness</p>
<p>As you develop your prompt engineering skills, it’s crucial to have
methods for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of your prompts.
This chapter will explore strategies for measuring prompt quality and
techniques for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>1. Metrics for Evaluating Prompt Quality</p>
<p>Assessing the effectiveness of your prompts involves both
quantitative and qualitative measures. Here are some key metrics to
consider:</p>
<p>Relevance</p>
<p>How well does the AI’s output address the specific task or question
posed in the prompt?</p>
<p>Evaluation method: Score responses on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is
completely irrelevant and 5 is highly relevant.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “On a scale of 1-5, how relevant was the AI’s
response to my original query? Provide a brief explanation for your
rating.”</p>
<p>Accuracy</p>
<p>Is the information provided by the AI correct and reliable?</p>
<p>Evaluation method: Fact-check key points against reliable sources and
calculate the percentage of accurate information.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “Review the following AI-generated text and identify
any factual errors or inaccuracies. List each error found and provide
the correct information.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Completeness</p>
<p>Does the AI’s response cover all aspects of the query or task?</p>
<p>Evaluation method: Create a checklist of expected elements and
calculate the percentage of elements addressed.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “I asked the AI to provide a project plan with the
following elements: timeline, resource allocation, budget breakdown, and
risk assessment. Please review the AI’s response and indicate which
elements were adequately addressed and which were missing or
incomplete.”</p>
<p>Clarity and Coherence</p>
<p>Is the AI’s output clear, well-organized, and easy to understand?</p>
<p>Evaluation method: Rate responses on a scale of 1-5 for clarity and
coherence.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “Evaluate the clarity and coherence of the following
AI-generated text on a scale of 1-5. Consider factors such as logical
flow, use of clear language, and overall organization. Provide a brief
explanation for your rating.”</p>
<p>Usefulness</p>
<p>How valuable is the AI’s output in addressing your specific needs or
solving your problem?</p>
<p>Evaluation method: Rate the usefulness on a scale of 1-5 and provide
qualitative feedback.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “On a scale of 1-5, how useful was the AI’s response
in addressing your specific task or problem? Explain your rating and
suggest how the response could have been more useful.”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>2. A/B Testing Prompts</p>
<p>A/B testing involves comparing two versions of a prompt to see which
produces better results. This can be a powerful tool for refining your
prompt engineering skills.</p>
<p>Steps for A/B Testing:</p>
<p>1. Create two versions of a prompt, changing one specific
element.</p>
<p>2. Use both prompts with the AI and collect the outputs.</p>
<p>3. Evaluate the outputs using the metrics discussed earlier.</p>
<p>4. Determine which prompt was more effective.</p>
<p>Example of A/B testing:</p>
<p>Prompt A: “Summarize the key points of the attached report.” Prompt
B: “Provide a detailed summary of the attached report, including the
main findings, methodology, and recommendations. Format the summary with
bullet points for easy readability.”</p>
<p>After testing both prompts, you might find that Prompt B consistently
produces more comprehensive and usable summaries.</p>
<p>3. Iterative Prompt Refinement</p>
<p>Improving your prompts is an iterative process. Here’s a structured
approach to refining your prompts over time:</p>
<p>1. Start with an initial prompt.</p>
<p>2. Evaluate the AI’s output using the metrics discussed earlier.</p>
<p>3. Identify areas for improvement in the prompt.</p>
<p>4. Revise the prompt based on your findings.</p>
<p>5. Test the new prompt and compare results.</p>
<p>6. Repeat the process until you achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>Example of Iterative Refinement:</p>
<p>Initial Prompt: “Give me ideas for improving customer
satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Evaluation: The response was too general and didn’t consider our
specific business context.</p>
<p>Refined Prompt: “Provide 5 specific strategies for improving customer
satisfaction in a B2B software company. For each strategy, include an
example of how it could be implemented and potential challenges to
consider.”</p>
<p>Evaluation: This response was more relevant and actionable, but
lacked data-driven insights.</p>
<p>Further Refined Prompt: “Based on common industry benchmarks and best
practices, suggest 5 data-driven strategies for improving customer
satisfaction in a B2B software company. For each strategy, provide:</p>
<p>A specific implementation plan</p>
<p>Potential challenges and how to overcome them</p>
<p>Metrics to track for measuring the strategy’s effectiveness</p>
<p>Please ensure the strategies are suitable for a company with
approximately 500 customers and an average deal size of <em>€</em>50,000
per year.”</p>
<p>4. Building a Prompt Library</p>
<p>As you develop effective prompts, it’s valuable to create a library
of successful prompts for future reference and reuse.</p>
<p>At the moment, there’s no single, all-powerful tool on the market to
manage your prompts. While several web options exist, it’s worth being
cautious about how they handle your data. For those in the Microsoft 365
ecosystem, you’ve got a variety of built-in tools at your disposal -
think OneNote, Planner, SharePoint, Lists, or Teams. Each has its own
strengths, so it’s up to you (and maybe your colleagues) to figure out
which one best fits your needs.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>OneNote might be great for freeform organization, while Planner
allows you to organize your prompts as cards. SharePoint or Lists allows
you to organize your prompts in tables, while Teams could be better for
quickly sharing successful prompts, although it’s probably not the best
tool for saving and structuring your prompts. As prompt engineering
continues to evolve, the key is to find a system that not only keeps you
organized but also aligns with your data security concerns.</p>
<p>Tips for Building a Prompt Library:</p>
<p>1. Categorize prompts by task type (e.g., summarization,
analysis,</p>
<p>brainstorming).</p>
<p>2. Include context about when and how to use each prompt.</p>
<p>3. Note any specific AI tools or models the prompt works best
with.</p>
<p>4. Include examples of successful outputs for reference.</p>
<p>5. Regularly review and update your library based on new learnings
and</p>
<p>changing needs.</p>
<p>Example Prompt Library Entry:</p>
<p>Category: Data Analysis</p>
<p>Prompt: “Analyze the attached sales data and provide the
following:</p>
<p>Top 3 performing products by revenue</p>
<p>Month-over-month growth rate</p>
<p>Identification of any seasonal trends</p>
<p>Suggestions for areas of improvement</p>
<p>Present the analysis in a clear, bulleted format suitable for
inclusion in a management report. Include one visualization suggestion
for each point of analysis.”</p>
<p>Context: Use this prompt when preparing monthly sales reports. It
works well with ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot when integrated with
Excel data. Successful Output Example: [Include a sanitized version of a
particularly good response]</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>5. Continuous Learning and Improvement</p>
<p>Prompt engineering is an evolving field, and there are always new
techniques and best practices to learn.</p>
<p>Strategies for Continuous Improvement:</p>
<p>1. Stay updated with the latest developments in AI and prompt
engineering</p>
<p>Example prompt: “Summarize the key developments in prompt engineering
techniques for large language models over the past six months. Focus on
practical applications for business users.”</p>
<p>2. Participate in online communities and forums dedicated to
prompt</p>
<p>engineering.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “Suggest 5 reputable online communities or forums
where I can discuss and learn about advanced prompt engineering
techniques for business applications.”</p>
<p>3. Experiment with new prompt techniques and AI tools regularly.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “I’ve been using basic prompt techniques like clear
instructions and role prompting. Suggest 3 advanced prompt engineering
techniques I could experiment with, and provide an example of how to
apply each in a business context.”</p>
<p>4. Seek feedback from colleagues on your AI-generated outputs.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “Draft a brief survey to gather feedback from my team
members on the quality and usefulness of the AI-generated reports I’ve
been producing. Include questions that will help me improve my prompt
engineering skills.”</p>
<p>5. Analyze unsuccessful prompts to understand what went wrong.</p>
<p>Example prompt: “Review this prompt and its unsuccessful output:
[insert prompt and output]. Identify potential issues with the prompt
and suggest three ways to improve it.”</p>
<p>By consistently measuring the effectiveness of your prompts and
engaging in continuous improvement, you can significantly enhance your
prompt engineering skills over time. Remember, the goal is not
perfection, but steady progress in your ability to leverage AI tools
effectively in your work.</p>

<p>You: “I need to set up a new project.”</p>
<p>AI: “Certainly! What’s the project about?”</p>
<p>You: “It’s a product launch for our new software.” AI: “Great. Based
on our previous product launches, I suggest we start by defining the
timeline, budget, and key milestones. Should I create a draft project
plan with these elements?”</p>
<p>Visual Prompt Building</p>
<p>We may see the development of visual interfaces for constructing
complex prompts, similar to visual programming languages. Example future
tool: A drag-and-drop interface where you can visually construct prompts
by combining elements like “data source”, “analysis type”, “output
format”, etc.</p>
<p>Automated Prompt Optimization</p>
<p>AI systems might develop the capability to automatically refine and
optimize prompts based on the desired outcome.</p>
<p>Example future scenario: You provide a basic prompt and the desired
outcome, and the AI suggests improvements to your prompt or
automatically refines it through multiple iterations to achieve the best
result.</p>
